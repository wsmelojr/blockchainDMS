abstract = {The literature does not present integral solutions to allow using the same credential to access the smart meter and smart house from an electric utility and vice-versa. The main reason being the technology gap in the communication between the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and the Internet. The technology used in the Internet domain to communicate with Data Concentrators (DC) and the electric utility is more powerful than the technology used in the communication between smart meters and the DC, which is bandwidth limited and better suited to the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Therefore, we are proposing the use of Identity Management (IdM) and a key-based scheme to enable the integration of IoT and the Internet using the same credentials, without creating a security bottleneck in the communication. An additional security mechanism is provided in the smart house context to isolate the house from direct accesses from the Internet, though allowing the utility to reconfigure the electric power consumption profile to avoid a potential blackout, for instance. Our proposal includes multi-sensor anti-tampering techniques to provide physical protection to a smart meter, in conjunction with a multilevel integrity mechanism to provide logical protection to its resource-constrained microcontroller, given the smart meter is a key component to mitigate electricity consumption fraud. The prototype has shown that our proposal is feasible for protecting the smart house, smart meter and the end-to-end communication between smart meter or house and the utility. {\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC},

abstract = {Vehicle speed is an important parameter in measurements of road traffic. At present, double-loop detectors are generally used for vehicular speed measurement. However, these detectors incur errors caused by scanning time, spacing between double loops, irregular vehicle trajectories, and the presence of multiple vehicles in the detection zone. This paper suggests a new model that uses an error-filtering algorithm to improve the accuracy of speed measurements. In the field tests, all percent errors of the vehicular speeds measured by the proposed model were within the error tolerance limit (plusmn5{\%}). Furthermore, the variance of percent errors was reduced. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed model significantly improves vehicle-speed-measuring accuracy},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel inductive loop sensor that can detect vehicles under a heterogeneous and less-lane- disciplined traffic and thus can be used to support a traffic control management system in optimizing the best use of existing roads. The loop sensor proposed in this paper detects large (e.g., bus) as well as small (e.g., bicycle) vehicles occupying any available space in the roadway, which is the main requirement for sensing heterogeneous and lane-less traffic. To accomplish the sensing of large as well as small vehicles, a multiple loop system with a new inductive loop sensor structure is proposed. The proposed sensor structure not only senses and segregates the vehicle type as bicycle, motor cycle, scooter, car, and bus but also enables accurate counting of the number of vehicles even in a mixed traffic flow condition. A prototype of the multiple loop sensing system has been developed and tested. Field tests indicate that the prototype successfully detected all types of vehicles and counted, correctly, the number of each type of vehicles. Thus, the suitability of the proposed sensor system for any type of traffic has been established.},

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have a vast field of applications, including deployment in hostile environments. Thus, the adoption of security mechanisms is fundamental. However, the extremely constrained nature of sensors and the potentially dynamic behavior of WSNs hinder the use of key management mechanisms commonly applied in modern networks. For this reason, many lightweight key management solutions have been proposed to overcome these constraints. In this paper, we review the state of the art of these solutions and evaluate them based on metrics adequate for WSNs. We focus on pre-distribution schemes well-adapted for homogeneous networks (since this is a more general network organization), thus identifying generic features that can improve some of these metrics. We also discuss some challenges in the area and future research directions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is a flexible permissioned blockchain platform designed for business applications beyond the basic digital coin addressed by Bitcoin and other existing networks. A key property of HLF is its extensibility, and in particular the support for multiple ordering services for building the blockchain. Nonetheless, the version 1.0 was launched in early 2017 without an implementation of a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) ordering service. To overcome this limitation, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a BFT ordering service for HLF on top of the BFT-SMaRt state machine replication/consensus library, implementing also optimizations for wide-area deployment. Our results show that HLF with our ordering service can achieve up to ten thousand transactions per second and write a transaction irrevocably in the blockchain in half a second, even with peers spread in different continents.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has become a promising ap- proach in many domains. It first came up with the cryptocur- rency Bitcoin, where it is used to maintain a distributed ledger, a public list of all transactions. It is assumed that the use of a blockchain as a cryptocurrency, or in general for financial services, was just the first stage, called Phase 1.0. The second phase began with the integration of smart contracts. In Phase 3.0, the focus lies on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which efficiently implement smart contracts. In the future, it is assumed, that by the use of DAOs many benefits for the public sector emerge. In this paper, blockchain applications of Phase 2.0 and 3.0 are analyzed for measuring instruments under legal control. An example are smart meters, where by smart contracts, a new coin/token within the blockchain can be created whenever the electric meter rotates. Promising areas of application in legal metrology, like a decentralized audit trail to log, e.g., software updates and hinder uncertified manipula- tions, the complete automation of the legally supervised update mechanism by smart contracts, or an alternative to public key infrastructures are being proposed in this paper.},

We propose a conceptual model for implementing measuring instruments in a distributed blockchain-based architecture, and compare it with traditional measuring instruments and distributed measuring models dis- cussed in previous works. We also develop a security analysis, demonstrating that blockchains-based measuring systems can impact how measuring instruments are used in consumer re- lations, at the same time that improve security and simplify metrological regulation and control.

abstract = {In Europe, measuring instruments under legal control are responsible for an annual turnover of 500 billion Euros and contribute a significant part to the economy including establishing trust between all stakeholders. In this article, a secure cloud reference architecture for measuring instruments is presented, addressing both requirements and roles in the Legal Metrology framework. With the introduction of Cloud Computing in Legal Metrology, a new role of a Cloud Service Provider has to be established. The general approach of the reference architecture shall be evaluated to determine if Cloud Computing can be integrated into the legal framework. In a bottom-up approach, each layer of the cloud is addressed and carefully tested against the essential requirements for LegalMetrology. Splitting a well-containedmeasuring instrument into a distributed measuring system creates new challenges guaranteeing security and integrity of themeasurements. Addressing these problems, technologies such as fully homomorphic encryption are evaluated, improved, and implemented to enable calculations on encrypted measurements. In addition, a secure communi- cation protocol for encrypted data is presented to address the demand of integrity of encrypted measurements throughout their lifecycle. Lastly, a continuous moni- toring approach is presented to detect anomalies and to classify the system behavior depending on their severity and impact into three categories: green, yellow, and red.},

Chaotic systems are always deterministic and may be very simple, yet they produce completely unpredictable and divergent behavior. Systems of nonlinear equations are difficult to solve analytically, and scientists have relied heavily on visual and qualitative approaches to discover and analyze the dynamics of nonlinearity. Indeed, few fields have drawn as heavily from visualization methods for their seminal innovations: from strange attractors, to bifurcation diagrams, to cobweb plots, to phase diagrams and embedding. Although the social sciences are increasingly studying these types of systems, seminal concepts remain murky or loosely adopted. This article has three aims. First, it argues for several visualization methods to critically analyze and understand the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems. Second, it uses these visualizations to introduce the foundations of nonlinear dynamics, chaos, fractals, self-similarity and the limits of prediction. Finally, it presents Pynamical, an open-source Python package to easily visualize and explore nonlinear dynamical systems' behavior.},

abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org). Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing blockchain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

The Joint Committee took on this part of the work of the ISO Technical Advisory Group 4 (TAG 4), which had developed the GUM and the VIM. The Joint Committee was originally made up of representatives from the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML). In 2005, the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) officially joined the seven founding international organizations. The JCGM has two Working Groups. Working Group 1 (JCGM/WG 1) on the GUM has the task of promoting the use of the GUM and preparing Supplements to the GUM for broad application. Working Group 2 (JCGM/WG 2) on the VIM has the task of revising the VIM and promoting its use. Working Group 2 is composed of up to two representatives of each member organization, supplemented by a limited number of experts. The third edition of the VIM has been prepared by Working Group 2. In 2004, a first draft of the third edition of the VIM was submitted for comments and proposals to the eight organizations represented in the JCGM, which in most cases consulted their members or affiliates, including numerous National Metrology Institutes. Comments were studied and discussed, taken into account when appropriate, and replied to by JCGM/WG 2. A final draft of the third edition was submitted in 2006 to the eight organizations for review and approval. All subsequent comments were considered and taken into account as appropriate by Working Group 2. The third edition of the VIM has been approved by each and all of the eight JCGM Member organizations. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition 1993.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the cyber security of vehicular impact tests (crash tests). A model attack describes main attacks that can be launched against the sensing and data acquisition system. For each attack, it is described countermeasures based on methodologies already consolidated in the literature. However, one of the described attacks is related with the difficult on identify that the expected sensors were indeed inside the vehicle during the test. For this attack is presented an original idea which is the emission of a unique identifier for each sensor using a light device. The identifier is recovered using a camera already present in the test context. The idea feasibility is demonstrated on a practical experiment.},

abstract = {In biology teaching, ecological subjects play an important role in dealing with nature in a responsible way. Empirical research has shown that, even after school instruction, students do not understand essential ecological concepts. The main reason is that preconceptions which influence learning are not taken into account in the construction of curricula. We combine findings from two independently-designed studies which have their main objectives in common. In both studies the focus is on students' conceptions of ecological terms and phenomena-ecosystem, and balance-and-change in nature. The studies were conducted within the framework of Educational Reconstruction, where three components of research are linked together: 'scientific clarification', 'comprehension of students' perspectives' and 'construction of instruction'. In order to capture the structure and quality of students' conceptions, qualitative methods were used. The results of both studies indicate that students tend to refer to more or less constant properties, in particular those which are visible in the everyday world. Processes are rarely their concern. Therefore the scientific conceptions of ecosystem, imbalance and the dynamics of biodiversity would be difficult for them to understand. For a better understanding, the dimensions of both space and time should be included in curricular design.},

abstract = {Modern systems are increasingly dependent on the integration of physical processes and information technologies. This trend is remarkable in applications involving sensor networks, cyberphysical systems, and Internet of Things. Despite its complexity, such integration results in physical context information that can be used to improve security, especially authentication. In this paper, we show that entities sharing the same physical context can use it for establishing a secure communication channel and protecting each other against external attacks.We present such approach proposing a theoretical model for generating unique bitstreams. Two different protocols are suggested. Each one is evaluated using probabilistic analysis and simulation. In the end, we implement the authentication mechanism in a case study using networks radio signal as physical event generator.Te results demonstrate the performance of each of the protocols and their suitability for applications in real world.},

@article{Fackrell2003,
abstract = {One of the problems associated with automotive fuel tanks is premature shut-off during the filling process. This occurs when the fuel dispensing nozzle shuts off before the fuel tank is completely filled. A comprehensive but simplified lumped parameter model has been developed to determine the pressure and flow rate associated with the automotive fuel tank for the purpose of predicting premature shut-off. Unlike previous work, this model includes the entire fuel system, including a closed rectangular tank with a filler tube, rollover valve, and vent tube that connects the filler tube to the tank. The system was divided into several control volumes and connecting valves. Continuity equations were written for each of the control volumes and energy equations were written for each of the connecting valves. The model includes the effects of the fuel tank system geometry, fuel nozzle dispensing rate, fuel volatility, multiphase, multicomponent flow through the filler tube, air/fuel vapour in the tank dome, vapour generation and choking in the vent tube, and the rollover valve due to the low speed of sound of the vapour droplet flow. This mathematical model consists of five nonlinear, integral equations and a number of algebraic equations. A commercial numerical solver (Simulink) was used to solve these equations subject to appropriate boundary conditions. The simplified model was used to generate results to compare with existing experimental results. In spite of its simplicity, it was capable of predicting the nature of the shut-off for all of the corresponding sets of experimental data. Prediction of the magnitudes of the tank dome pressure and the filler tube pressure were, however, only in fair agreement with the experimental values. The model was also used to perform a sensitivity analysis of model parameters. The results were found to be most sensitive to vent area around the filler nozzle, liquid dispensing flowrate, and fuel volatility.},

An accurate analysis of the collected data has been performed to identify the main parameters able to monitor driver behavior and to define suitable indexes to evaluate the driving performance. Particular attention has been paid to the analysis of vehicle parameters during braking and gear shifting in order to classify different attitudes and generate driver profiles and trends. Understanding drivers' characteristic behavior can contribute significantly to road safety, to define insurance premium, to engage user in saving fuel and money and to correlate faults of the car with the driving style.},

Distributed ledgers have recently found widespread interest in this domain due to their ability to provide transactional integrity across decentralized computing nodes. However, the existing state of the art has not focused on the privacy preservation requirement of these energy systems - the transaction level data can provide much greater insights into a prosumer's behavior compared to smart meter data. There are specific safety requirements in transactive microgrids to ensure the stability of the grid and to control the load. To fulfil these requirements, the distribution system operator needs transaction information from the grid, which poses a further challenge to the privacy goals. In this paper, we extend a recently developed trading workflow called PETra and describe our solution for communication and transactional anonymity.},

abstract = {Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable energy resources and improvements in battery technology. While these changes enhance sustainability and efficiency, they also create significant management challenges as the complexity of power systems increases. To tackle these challenges, decentralized Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. Within a transactive microgrid, ``prosumers'' (i.e., consumers with energy generation and storage capabilities) can trade energy with each other, thereby smoothing the load on the main grid using local supply. It is hard, however, to provide security, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive energy system. On the one hand, prosumers' personal information must be protected from their trade partners and the system operator. On the other hand, the system must be protected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize the entire grid. This paper describes $\backslash$emph{\{}Privacy-preserving Energy Transactions{\}} (PETra), which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids that enables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy. PETra builds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and provides anonymity for communication, bidding, and trading.},

abstract = {Solutions for pairing devices without prior security associations typically require users to actively take part in the pairing process of the devices. Scenarios involving new types of devices like Internet-of-Things (IoT) appliances and wearable devices make it, however, desirable to be able to pair users' personal devices without user involvement. In this paper, we present a new approach for secure zero-interaction pairing suitable for IoT and wearable devices. We primarily require pairing to happen between "correct" devices -- the devices that the user intends to pair. Our pairing scheme identifies the correct devices based on measuring sustained co-presence over time. We do this by having the devices compute a fingerprint of their ambient context using information gathered through commonly available sensor modalities like ambient noise and luminosity. We introduce a novel robust and inexpensive approach for fingerprinting contexts over time. Co-present devices will observe roughly similar context fingerprints that we use in a key evolution protocol to gradually increase the confidence in the authenticity of the correct devices. Our experiments show the effectiveness of this approach for zero-interaction pairing.},

abstract = {Zero-Interaction Authentication (ZIA) refers to approaches that authenticate a user to a verifier (terminal) without any user interaction. Currently deployed ZIA solutions are predominantly based on the terminal detecting the proximity of the user's personal device, or a security token, by running an authentication protocol over a short-range wireless communication channel. Unfortunately, this simple approach is highly vulnerable to low-cost and practical relay attacks which completely offset the usability benefits of ZIA. The use of contextual information, gathered via on-board sensors, to detect the co-presence of the user and the verifier is a recently proposed mechanism to resist relay attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate the performance of different sensor modalities for co-presence detection with respect to a standard Dolev-Yao adversary. First, using a common data collection framework run in realistic everyday settings, we compare the performance of four commonly available sensor modalities (WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, and Audio) in resisting ZIA relay attacks, and find that WiFi is better than the rest. Second, we show that, compared to any single modality, fusing multiple modalities improves resilience against ZIA relay attacks while retaining a high level of usability. Third, we motivate the need for a stronger adversarial model to characterize an attacker who can compromise the integrity of context sensing itself. We show that in the presence of such a powerful attacker, each individual sensor modality offers very low security. Positively, the use of multiple sensor modalities improves security against such an attacker if the attacker cannot compromise multiple modalities simultaneously.},

In particular, the wireless channel has been investigated as a common source of secrecy to generate a shared secret key.We explore the most recent approaches in this area. Received signal strength indicator based key generation is firstly investigated. After that, we present some of the most recent approaches of key generation based on the channel impulse response.

It is essential for these devices to gen- erate the shared secret key used for data encryption period- ically. Recent studies have exploited wireless channel char- acteristics, e.g., received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to derive the shared secret key during random body movement of subject wearing devices. However, in the absence of node mobility, these schemes have very low bit rate capacity, and fail to derive keys with good entropy, which is a big threat for security. In this work, we study the effectiveness of combining dual antennas and frequency diversity for obtaining uncorrelated channel samples to improve entropy of key and bit rate in static channel conditions. We propose a novel mobility inde- pendent RSSI based secret key generation protocol – iARC for WBAN. We conduct an extensive set of experiments in real time environments on sensor platforms used in WBAN to validate the performance of iARC. iARC has 800 bps secrecy capacity and generates 128 bit key in only 160 ms.

abstract = {We investigate the security of Diffie-Hellman key exchange as used in popular Internet protocols and find it to be less secure than widely believed. First, we present a novel flaw in TLS that allows a man-in-the-middle to downgrade connections to “export-grade” Diffie-Hellman. To carry out this attack, we implement the number field sieve discrete log algorithm. After a week-long precomputation for a specified 512-bit group, we can compute arbitrary discrete logs in this group in minutes. We find that 82{\%} of vulnerable servers use a single 512-bit group, allowing us to compromise connections to 7{\%} of Alexa Top Million HTTPS sites. In response, major browsers are being changed to reject short groups. We go on to consider Diffie-Hellman with 768- and 1024-bit groups. A small number of fixed or standardized groups are in use by millions of TLS, SSH, and VPN servers. Performing precomputations on a few of these groups would allow a passive eavesdropper to decrypt a large fraction of Internet traffic. In the 1024-bit case, we estimate that such computations are plausible given nation-state resources, and a close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agency's attacks on VPNs are consistent with having achieved such a break. We conclude that moving to stronger key exchange methods should be a priority for the Internet community.},

The biggest problem is tax evasions that favor one group of business entities at the expense of another, and also cause that the state loses revenues mainly from indirect taxes. Therefore, attention is directed to quality control of fuels as a means of consumer protection and prevention of tax evasion and ways to combat tax evasion in import, distribution and storage of mineral oils. The examples are the most common errors found in fraudulent companies. Based on the data collected the possible ultimate evasion was estimated. Therefore, I propose that value added tax law should be amended and some other measures to improve supervision by public authorities like tax authorities and customs administration offices should be taken.},

abstract = {—Bitcoin has emerged as the most successful crypto-graphic currency in history. Within two years of its quiet launch in 2009, Bitcoin grew to comprise billions of dollars of economic value despite only cursory analysis of the system's design. Since then a growing literature has identified hidden-but-important properties of the system, discovered attacks, proposed promis-ing alternatives, and singled out difficult future challenges. Meanwhile a large and vibrant open-source community has proposed and deployed numerous modifications and extensions. We provide the first systematic exposition Bitcoin and the many related cryptocurrencies or 'altcoins.' Drawing from a scattered body of knowledge, we identify three key components of Bitcoin's design that can be decoupled. This enables a more insightful analysis of Bitcoin's properties and future stability. We map the design space for numerous proposed modifica-tions, providing comparative analyses for alternative consensus mechanisms, currency allocation mechanisms, computational puzzles, and key management tools. We survey anonymity issues in Bitcoin and provide an evaluation framework for analyzing a variety of privacy-enhancing proposals. Finally we provide new insights on what we term disintermediation protocols, which absolve the need for trusted intermediaries in an interesting set of applications. We identify three general disintermediation strategies and provide a detailed comparison. I. WHY BITCOIN IS WORTHY OF RESEARCH Consider two opposing viewpoints on Bitcoin in straw-man form. The first is that " Bitcoin works in practice, but not in theory. " At times devoted members of the Bitcoin community espouse this philosophy and criticize the security research community for failing to discover Bitcoin, not im-mediately recognizing its novelty, and still today dismissing it due to the lack of a rigorous theoretical foundation. A second viewpoint is that Bitcoin's stability relies on an unknown combination of socioeconomic factors which is hopelessly intractable to model with sufficient precision, failing to yield a convincing argument for the system's soundness. Given these difficulties, experienced security re-searchers may avoid Bitcoin as a topic of study, considering it prudent security engineering to only design systems with precise threat models that admit formal security proofs. We intend to show where each of these simplistic view-points fail. To the first, we contend that while Bitcoin has worked surprisingly well in practice so far, there is an im-portant role for research to play in identifying precisely why this has been possible, moving beyond a blind acceptance of the informal arguments presented with the system's initial proposal. Furthermore, it is crucial to understand whether Bitcoin will still " work in practice " as practices change. We expect external political and economic factors to evolve, the system must change if and when transaction volume scales, and the nature of the monetary rewards for Bitcoin miners will change over time as part of the system design. It is not enough to argue that Bitcoin has worked from 2009– 2014 and will therefore continue likewise. We do not yet have sufficient understanding to conclude with confidence that Bitcoin will continue to work well in practice, which is a crucial research challenge that requires insight from computer science theory. To the second viewpoint, we contend that Bitcoin is filling an important niche by providing a virtual currency system without any trusted parties and without pre-assumed identities among the participants. Within these constraints, the general problem of consensus in a distributed system is impossible [7], [93] without further assumptions like Bitcoin's premise that rational (greedy) behavior can be modeled and incentives can be aligned to ensure secure operation of the consensus algorithm. Yet these constraints matter in practice, both philosophically and technically, and Bitcoin's approach to consensus within this model is deeply surprising and a fundamental contribution. Bitcoin's core consensus protocol also has profound implications for many other computer security problems beyond currency 1 such as distributed naming, secure timestamping and commitment, generation of public randomness, as well as many finan-cial problems such as self-enforcing (" smart ") contracts, decentralized markets and order books, and distributed au-tonomous agents. In short, even though Bitcoin is not easy to model, it is worthy of considerable research attention as it may form the basis for practical solutions to exceedingly difficult and important problems. With this dichotomy in mind, we set out to synthesize the collective knowledge from the first six years of Bitcoin's operation and development, as well as from its many derived cryptocurrencies. Our goal is both to highlight the many areas where significant innovation has already occurred, ranging from novel payment protocols to user-friendly key management, and also highlight the most important open research challenges for Bitcoin and future cryptocurrencies.},

abstract = {In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of Shared Sensor Networks (SSNs) as a core component of cyber-physical systems for diverse applications. As Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) design starts shifting from application-specific platforms to shared system infrastructures, a pressing research challenge is security. In scenarios involving unprotected hostile outdoor areas, SSNs are prone to different types of attacks that can compromise reliability, integrity, and availability of the sensor data traffic and sensor lifetime as well. In this work we propose a Dynamic Security System to be applied in the shared sensor network context. Its basic feature is the nodes neighborhood monitoring and collaboration (through the use of the Byzantine algorithm) to identify an attack and enhance security. The proposed security system is dynamic since it is able to manage the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of multiple applications according to the current execution context. It is also resilient, since it is able to support the continuous network operation even in the presence of malicious or faulty nodes. Its resilience is achieved for the capacity of gathering information from several nodes, thus inferring the countermeasures using context information. {\textcopyright} 2015 Claudio M. de Farias et al.},

The integration of renewable, low-polluting, distributed energy resources in the power grid is an important step toward sustainable development. In this article, we propose two architectures, clustered and distributed, for labeling the energy source provided to the smart grid. A label contains the energy amount provided to the smart grid and its sustainability index. Labels from multiple energy sources can be compounded and displayed to end users accordingly with the architecture used to inform how sustainable the production process of the energy being rendered to the consumers in a given area is. The comprehension of how sustainable the energy production is can entail a change of mind in consumers and energy distributors. We also evaluate both architectures according to the the sustainability index accuracy and generated network traffic. {\textcopyright} 1979-2012 IEEE.},

Those improvements can be seen as a natural transition toward an effective Smart grid, and have brought together the needs of a deep revision on regulatory procedures for the electrical meters evaluation conducted by the Brazilian Metrology Office. This paper shows that the increasing complexity from those new electrical grid equipments, particularly conveyed by additional software procedures, is a major issue and needs to be rapidly assimilated by metrological controls to avoid the appearance of stepping stones in the smart grid pathway.

To address this, the Lightweight Blockchain Authentication for Constrained Sensors (LBACS) scheme was proposed and evaluated using quantitative and qualitative methods. LBACS was designed with constrained Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in mind and independent of a blockchain implementation. It asserts the authentication and provenance of constrained IoT on the blockchain utilizing a multi-signature approach facilitated by symmetric and asymmetric methods and sufficient considerations for key and certificate registry management. The metrics, threat assessment and comparison to existing WSN authentication schemes conducted asserted the pragmatic use of LBACS to provide authentication, blockchain provenance, integrity, auditable, revocation, weak backward and forward secrecy and universal forgeability. The research has several implications for the ubiquitous use of IoT and growing interest in the blockchain.},

However, there exist several challenges, such as optimizing the tradeoff between the use of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources, to leverage affordable electric power while minimizing carbon emissions. Game theoretic approaches have been widely used in various scientific domains and have recently also increasingly been used in smart grids, whereby evolutionary paradigms have been widely deployed as a popular heuristic search method to solve and optimize complex real-life scientific problems. A promising approach is the development of such evolutionary algorithms and game theoretic approaches in the context of open energy markets. In this paper, we develop an analytic model of a multileader and multifollower Stackelberg game approach and propose a bi-level hybrid multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to find optimal strategies that maximize the profit of utilities, and minimize carbon emissions in an open energy market among interconnected microsources.},

In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a blockchain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party. Unlike Bitcoin, transactions in our system are not strictly financial – they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to blockchains that could harness them into a well-rounded solution for trusted computing problems in society.},

abstract = {Blockchains generated using a proof- of-work consensus protocol, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, are promising sources of public random- ness. However, the randomness is subject to manip- ulation by the miners generating the blockchain. A general defense is to apply a delay function, preventing malicious miners from computing the random output until it is too late to manipulate it. Ideally, this delay function can provide a short proof- of-delay that is efficient enough to be verified within a smart contract, enabling the randomness source to be directly by smart contracts. In this paper we describe the challenges of solving this problem given the extremely limited computational capacity available in Ethereum, the most popular general- purpose smart contract framework to date. We introduce a novel multi-round protocol for verifying delay functions using a refereed delegation model. We provide a prototype Ethereum implementation to analyze performance and find that it is feasible in terms of gas costs, costing roughly 180000 gas (US{\$} 0.111) to post a beacon and 720000 gas (US{\$} 0.98) to resolve a dispute . We also discuss the incentive challenges raised by providing a secure randomness beacon as a public good.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are being increasingly used in several application areas, particularly to collect data and monitor physical processes. Non-functional requirements, like reliability, security or availability, are often important and must be accounted for in the application development. For that purpose, there is a large body of knowledge on dependability techniques for distributed systems, which provide a good basis to understand how to satisfy these non-functional requirements of WSN-based monitoring applications. Given the data-centric nature of monitoring applications, it is of particular importance to ensure that data are reliable or, more generically, that they have the necessary quality. In this survey, we look into the problem of ensuring the desired quality of data for dependable monitoring using WSNs. We take a dependability-oriented perspective, reviewing the possible impairments to dependability and the prominent existing solutions to solve or mitigate these impairments. Despite the variety of components that may form a WSN-based monitoring system, we give particular attention to understanding which faults can affect sensors, how they can affect the quality of the information and how this quality can be improved and quantified.},

abstract = {More and more renewable sources are integrated into electric power grids worldwide. Their high generation dynamics, however, require power grid operators to monitor electricity generation and demand at a fine temporal resolution. Even small mismatches between supply and demand can impact the power grid's stability, and thus ultimately lead to blackouts. As a result, smart metering equipment has been widely deployed to collect real-time information about the current grid load and forward it to utilities in a timely manner. Numerous research works have shown that power consumption data can, however, reveal the nature of used appliances and their mode of operation at high accuracy. This effectively puts user privacy at risk. In this manuscript, we investigate to which extent the local preprocessing of power data can mitigate this risk. We thus compare the efficacy of different preprocessing steps to eliminate characteristic consumption patterns from the data. Our evaluation shows that a combination of these preprocessing steps can provide a balanced trade-off that is in the interests of both users (privacy protection) and utilities (accurate and timely reporting).},

Data aggregation and data perturbation are two such techniques. This paper provides quantitative means to identify a tradeoff between the aggregation set size, the precision on the aggregated measurements, and the privacy level. This is achieved by formally defining an attack to the privacy of an individual user and calculating how much its success probability is reduced by applying data perturbation. Under the assumption of time-correlation of the measurements, colored noise can be used to even further reduce the success probability. The tightness of the analytical results is evaluated by comparing them to experimental data.},

Following an intensive review on advanced smart metering and communication infrastructures, the strategy for integrating the EVs into the electric grid is presented. Various EV smart charging technologies are also extensively examined with the perspective of their potential, impacts and limitations under the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) phenomenon. Moreover, the high penetration of renewable energy sources (wind and photovoltaic solar) is soaring up into the power system. However, their intermittent power output poses different challenges on the planning, operation and control of the power system networks. On the other hand, the deployment of EVs in the energy market can compensate for the fluctuations of the electric grid.

@article{Navani2012,
abstract = {India faces endemic electrical energy and peaking shortages. These shortages have had a very detrimental effect on the overall economic growth of the country. As total distribution system losses equals technical losses plus non-technical losses. The reasons cited for such high losses are; lack of adequate T {\&} D capacity, too many transformation stages, improper load distribution and extensive rural electrification etc. Simply Losses could be defined as the difference between the metered units of electricity entering the distribution network and those leaving the network paid for through electricity accounts, whether estimated or metered, in a well defined period of time. Technical losses are regarded as the electrical system losses which are caused by network impedance, current flows and auxiliary supplies. The sources of technical losses may be directly driven by network investment or by network operation. Non-technical losses arise from several areas including theft, un-billed accounts, and estimated customer accounts, errors due to the approximation of consumption by un-metered supplies and metering errors. The purpose of this paper is to analyse Technical and Non Technical Losses with the help of a case study and MATLAB Simulation in power systems.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a blockchain verification protocol as a method for enabling and securing spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks. The spectrum-sharing mechanism is used as a medium access protocol for accessing wireless bandwidth among competing cognitive radios. We introduce a virtual currency, called “Specoins”, for payment to access spectrum. An auction mechanism based on a first-come-first-served queue is used, with the price for the spectrum advertised by each primary user in a decentralized fashion. The blockchain protocol facilitates the transactions between primary and secondary users, and is used to validate and save each user's virtual wallet. The blockchain also serves as a distributed database that is visible by all participating parties and any node can volunteer to update the blockchain. The volunteer nodes are called miners and they are awarded with Specoins. We propose diverse methods to exchange the Specoins in order to make leasing possible even by cognitive radios that are not miners. We show the improvement of the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional Aloha medium access protocol in terms of spectrum usage.},

Today, measuring instruments are frequently integrated into open networks and even branch into the areas of cloud computing and Internet of Things. Since software is one of the key components of such devices, Germany's national metrology institute, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesantalt, is developing a method to assess the risks and evaluate current threats associated with software. The method uses the structure of and combines elements from the international ISO/IEC standards 27005 and 15408. It could be helpful for conformity assessment bodies and industry alike and supports the comparability of risk assessment results.

abstract = {Zero-Interaction Authentication (ZIA) refers to approaches that authenticate a user to a verifier (terminal) without any user interaction. Currently deployed ZIA solutions are predominantly based on the terminal detecting the proximity of the user's personal device, or a security token, by running an authentication protocol over a short-range wireless communication channel. Unfortunately, this simple approach is highly vulnerable to low-cost and practical relay attacks which completely offset the usability benefits of ZIA. The use of contextual information, gathered via on-board sensors, to detect the co-presence of the user and the verifier is a recently proposed mechanism to resist relay attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate the performance of different sensor modalities for co-presence detection with respect to a standard Dolev-Yao adversary. First, using a common data collection framework run in realistic everyday settings, we compare the performance of four commonly available sensor modalities (WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, and audio) in resisting ZIA relay attacks, and find that WiFi is better than the rest. Second, we show that, compared to any single modality, fusing multiple modalities improves resilience against ZIA relay attacks while retaining a high level of usability. Third, we motivate the need for a stronger adversarial model to characterize an attacker who can compromise the integrity of context sensing itself. We show that in the presence of such a powerful attacker, each individual sensor modality offers very low security. Positively, the use of multiple sensor modalities improves security against such an attacker if the attacker cannot compromise multiple modalities simultaneously. Finally, based on our analysis, we integrate our contextual co-presence detection system with a real-world ZIA application, BlueProximity [1], so as to enhance its security against relay attacks. We describe the design of the BlueProximity++ application and present results from a small-scale user study that evaluated its effectiveness.},

abstract = {Transparent authentication (TA) schemes are those in which a user is authenticated by a verifier without requiring explicit user interaction. By doing so, those schemes promise high usability and security simultaneously. The majority of TA implementations rely on the received signal strength as an indicator for the proximity of a user device (prover). However, such implicit proximity verification is not secure against an adversary who can relay messages over a larger distance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for thwarting relay attacks in TA schemes: the prover permits access to authentication credentials only if it can confirm that it is near the verifier. We present STASH, a system for relay-resilient transparent authentication in which the prover does proximity verification by comparing its approach trajectory towards the intended verifier with known authorized reference trajectories. Trajectories are measured using low-cost sensors commonly available on personal devices. We demonstrate the security of STASH against a class of adversaries and its ease-of-use by analyzing empirical data, collected using a STASH prototype. STASH is efficient and can be easily integrated to complement existing TA schemes.},

abstract = {Software attestation has become a popular and challenging research topic at many established security conferences with an expected strong impact in practice. It aims at verifying the software integrity of (typically) resource-constrained em- bedded devices. However, for practical reasons, software at- testation cannot rely on stored cryptographic secrets or ded- icated trusted hardware. Instead, it exploits side-channel in- formation, such as the time that the underlying device needs for a specific computation. As traditional cryptographic so- lutions and arguments are not applicable, novel approaches for the design and analysis are necessary. This is certainly one of the main reasons why the security goals, properties and underlying assumptions of existing software attestation schemes have been only vaguely discussed so far, limiting the confidence in their security claims. Thus, putting soft- ware attestation on a solid ground and having a founded approach for designing secure software attestation schemes is still an important open problem. We provide the first steps towards closing this gap. Our first contribution is a security framework that formally cap- tures security goals, attacker models and various system and design parameters. Moreover, we present a generic software attestation scheme that covers most existing schemes in the literature. Finally, we analyze its security within our frame- work, yielding sufficient conditions for provably secure soft- ware attestation schemes. We expect that such a consolidat- ing work allows for a meaningful security analysis of existing schemes, supports the design of secure software attestation schemes and will inspire new research in this area.},

abstract = {Embedded computing devices increasingly permeate many aspects of modern life: from medical to automotive, from building and factory automation to weapons, from critical infrastructures to home entertainment. Despite their specialized nature as well as limited resources and connectivity, these devices are now becoming an increasingly popular and attractive target for attacks, especially, malware infections. A number of approaches have been suggested to detect and/or mitigate such attacks. They vary greatly in terms of application generality and underlying assumptions. However, one common theme is the need for Remote Attestation, a distinct security service that allows a trusted party (verifier) to check the internal state of a remote untrusted embedded device (prover). Many prior methods assume some form of trusted hardware on the prover, which is not a good option for small and low-end embedded devices. To this end, we investigate the feasibility of Remote Attestation without trusted hardware. This paper provides a systematic treatment of Remote Attestation, starting with a precise definition of the desired service and proceeding to its systematic deconstruction into necessary and sufficient properties. Next, these are mapped into a minimal collection of hardware and software components that result in secure Remote Attestation. One distinguishing feature of this line of research is the need to prove (or, at least argue for) architectural minimality -- an aspect rarely encountered in security research. This work also provides a promising platform for attaining more advanced security services and guarantees.},

abstract = {With more than three billion internet users, each with multiple digital identities, the management of these identities is very important. Surveys show that people often use the identity management systems they don't want to use. They don't have full control over their infor- mation, have no way to know what is shared with other parties and are dependent on trusted parties when logging in to websites. Blockchain technology is used as basis for a secure and transparent distributed ledger for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Its decentralized, pub- lic and immutable properties solve the double spending problem and allow every participant of the network to read the transaction history, help in the validation process and pay and receive Bitcoin. Cryptographically complex math ensures that everyone can do trans- actions with everyone without the need for a trusted third party. Next to nancial transactions, this also holds for other claims. Entities can put claims on a decentralized ledger by digitally signing it, which allows any other entity to verify that these claims are made by that speci c entity. This allows authorities like governments to make claims about indi- viduals, which can be combined with other claims to create a very strong claim about someone. Because both the claimant and the claimee can be veri ed, this allows entities like mortgage lenders to outsource their Customer Due Diligence (CDD) processes. In this research we will explore the possibility of self-sovereign identity, where you are in control of your digital identity. We started with a desk research on currently available identity man- agement solutions. We concluded that in most systems, the end-user is not able to store their own data. Currently only one decentralized system is available, but has not gained wide adoption yet. A case study has been performed on a solution which allows the ex- change of KYC attributes, resulting from thorough Customer Due Dili- gence (CDD) as is often performed when opening a bank account. These attributes can be used by other entities, like insurance companies and mortgage lenders to make their on-boarding process easier for customers, since they don't need to supply copies of the same documentation all over again. Also, the companies themselves could outsource their Customer Due Diligence (CDD) this way to lower costs and make fewer errors. Al- though the idea is very interesting, the studied solution did not meet the expectations. At the time the company behind the solution was very small and the process to improve very complex. The solution was also propri- etary, creating dependence on the vendor, which heightens the adoption barrier. Because of the lessons learned from the case study, the results of the literature research and the desk research, we designed an architecture for a Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS) using the concept of claim-based identity and blockchain technology. To lower adoption barriers and create a self-sustaining ecosystem, it will be developed on a public blockchain and source code will be made open-source. The solution will be privacy-friendly by using privacy-enhancing techniques and storing only claims about one's identity. We also provide a solution to allow retrieval of more sensitive data, and made it as modular as possible to make integration within existing IT architecture easier. The Decentralized Identity Management System (DIMS) can be use- ful in a wide range of use cases, like proving your age when buying liquor at the supermarket or applying for a health insurance where you get a student discount if you can show your are enrolled at a university. This shows that our work resulted in a solid foundation for self-sovereign identity using blockchain technology.},

abstract = {Bitcoin cryptocurrency demonstrated the utility of global consensus across thousands of nodes, changing the world of digital transactions forever. In the early days of Bitcoin, the performance of its probabilistic proof-of-work (PoW) based consensus fabric, also known as blockchain, was not a major issue. Bitcoin became a success story, despite its consensus latencies on the order of an hour and the theoretical peak throughput of only up to 7 transactions per second.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe situation today is radically different and the poor performance scalability of early PoW blockchains no longer makes sense. Specifically, the trend of modern cryptocurrency platforms, such as Ethereum, is to support execution of arbitrary distributed applications on blockchain fabric, needing much better performance. This approach, however, makes cryptocurrency platforms step away from their original purpose and enter the domain of database-replication protocols, notably, the classical state-machine replication, and in particular its Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) variants.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nIn this paper, we contrast PoW-based blockchains to those based on BFT state machine replication, focusing on their scalability limits. We also discuss recent proposals to overcoming these scalability limits and outline key outstanding open problems in the quest for the “ultimate” blockchain fabric(s).},

abstract = {Modern industrial communication networks are increasingly based on open protocols and platforms that are also used in the office IT and Internet environment. This reuse facilitates development and deployment of highly connected systems, but also makes the communication system vulnerable to electronic attacks. This paper gives an overview of IT security issues in industrial automation systems which are based on open communication systems. First, security objectives, electronic attack methods, and the available countermeasures for general IT systems are described. General security objectives and best practices are listed. Particularly for the TCP/IP protocol suite, a wide range of cryptography-based secure communication protocols is available. The paper describes their principles and scope of application. Next, we focus on industrial communication systems, which have a number of security-relevant characteristics distinct from the office IT systems. Confidentiality of transmitted data may not be required; however, data and user authentication, as well as access control are crucial for the mission critical and safety critical operation of the automation system. As a result, modern industrial automation systems, if they include security measures at all, emphasize various forms of access control. The paper describes the status of relevant specifications and implementations for a number of standardized automation protocols. Finally, we illustrate the application of security concepts and tools by brief case studies describing security issues in the configuration and operation of substations, plants, or for remote access.},

abstract = {By 2012 the U.S. military had increased its investment in research and production of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from 2.3 billion in 2008 to 4.2 billion [1]. Currently UAVs are used for a wide range of missions such as border surveillance, reconnaissance, transportation and armed attacks. UAVs are presumed to provide their services at any time, be reliable, automated and autonomous. Based on these presumptions, governmental and military leaders expect UAVs to improve national security through surveillance or combat missions. To fulfill their missions, UAVs need to collect and process data. Therefore, UAVs may store a wide range of information from troop movements to environmental data and strategic operations. The amount and kind of information enclosed make UAVs an extremely interesting target for espionage and endangers UAVs of theft, manipulation and attacks. Events such as the loss of an RQ-170 Sentinel to Iranian military forces on 4th December 2011 [2] or the “keylogging” virus that infected an U.S. UAV fleet at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada in September 2011 [3] show that the efforts of the past to identify risks and harden UAVs are insufficient. Due to the increasing governmental and military reliance on UAVs to protect national security, the necessity of a methodical and reliable analysis of the technical vulnerabilities becomes apparent. We investigated recent attacks and developed a scheme for the risk assessment of UAVs based on the provided services and communication infrastructures. We provide a first approach to an UAV specific risk assessment and take into account the factors exposure, communication systems, storage media, sensor systems and fault handling mechanisms. We used this approach to assess the risk of some currently used UAVs: The “MQ-9 Reaper” and the “AR Drone”. A risk analysis of the “RQ-170 Sentinel” is discussed.},

abstract = {Truck platooning is emerging as a promising solution with many economic incentives. However, securely admitting a new vehicle into a platoon is an extremely important yet difficult task. There is no adequate method today for verifying physical arrangements of vehicles within a platoon formation. Specifically, we address the problem of a platoon ghost attack wherein an attacker spoofs presence within a platoon to gain admission and subsequently execute malicious attacks. To address such concerns, we present Convoy, a novel autonomous platoon admission scheme which binds the vehicles' digital certificates to their physical context (i.e., locality). Convoy exploits the findings that vehicles traveling together experience similar context to prove to each other over time that they are co-present. Specifically, they experience similar road (e.g., bumps and cracks) and traffic (e.g., acceleration and steering) conditions. Our approach is based on the ability for vehicles to capture this context, generate fingerprints to establish shared keys, and later bind these symmetric keys to their public keys. We design and implement the Convoy protocol and evaluate it with realworld driving data. Our implementation demonstrates that vehicles traveling in adjacent lanes can be sufficiently distinguished by their context and this can be utilized to thwart platoon ghost attacks and similar misbehavior.},

abstract = {Although awareness is constantly rising, that industrial computer networks (in a very broad sense) can be exposed to serious cyber threats, many people still think that the same countermeasures, developed to protect general-purpose computer networks, can be effectively adopted also in those situations where a physical system is managed/controlled through some distributed Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as several examples of successful attacks carried out in the last decade, and more frequently in the very recent past, have dramatically shown. Experts in this area know very well that often the peculiarities of industrial networks prevent the adoption of classical approaches to their security and, in particular, of those popular solutions that are mainly based on a detect and patch philosophy. This paper is a contribution, from the security point of view, to the assessment of the current situation of a wide class of industrial distributed computing systems. In particular, the analysis presented in this paper takes into account the process of ensuring a satisfactory degree of security for a distributed industrial system, with respect to some key elements such as the system characteristics, the current state of the art of standardization and the adoption of suitable controls (countermeasures) that can help in lowering the security risks below a predefined, acceptable threshold. {\textcopyright} 2005-2012 IEEE.},

However, in contrast to safety testing systematic testing against potential security gaps is not yet a common procedure within the automotive domain. This however could eventually enable a malicious entity to be able to attack a safety-critical IT component or even the whole vehicle. Several real-world demonstrations have already shown that this risk is not only academic theory [1]. Facing this challenge, the paper at hand first introduces some potential automotive security attacks and some important automotive security threats. It then explains in more detail how to identify and evaluate potential security threats for automotive IT components based on theoretical security analyses and practical security testing. Lastly, we propose “automotive security evaluation assurance levels” (ASEAL) which define up to four discrete security testing levels. 1},

abstract = {While Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been traditionally tasked with single applications, in recent years we have witnessed the emergence of Shared Sensor Networks (SSNs) as integrated cyber-physical system infrastructures for a multitude of applications. Instead of assuming an application-specific network design, SSNs allow the underlying infrastructure to be shared among multiple applications that can potentially belong to different users. On one hand, a potential benefit of such a design approach is to increase the utilization of sensing and communication resources, whenever the underlying network infrastructure covers the same geographic area and the sensor nodes monitor the same physical variables of common interest for different applications. On the other hand, compared with the existing application-specific design, the SSNs approach poses several research challenges with regard to different aspects of WSNs. In this article, we present a systematic literature survey on SSNs. The main goal of the article is to provide the reader with the opportunity to understand what has been done and what remains as open issues in this field, as well as which are the pivotal factors of this evolutionary design and how this kind of design can be exploited by a wide range of WSN applications.},

abstract = {The normalized information distance is a universal distance measure for objects of all kinds. It is based on Kolmogorov complexity and thus uncomputable, but there are ways to utilize it. First, compression algorithms can be used to approximate the Kolmogorov complexity if the objects have a string representation. Second, for names and abstract concepts, page count statistics from the World Wide Web can be used. These practical realizations of the normalized information distance can then be applied to machine learning tasks, expecially clustering, to perform feature-free and parameter-free data mining. This chapter discusses the theoretical foundations of the normalized information distance and both practical realizations. It presents numerous examples of successful real-world applications based on these distance measures, ranging from bioinformatics to music clustering to machine translation.},

abstract = {With its high penetration rate and relatively good clock ac- curacy, smartphones are replacing watches in several market segments. Modern smartphones have more than one clock source to complement each other: NITZ (Network Identity and Time Zone), NTP (Network Time Protocol), and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) including GPS. NITZ information is delivered by the cellular core network, indi- cating the network name and clock information. NTP pro- vides a facility to synchronize the clock with a time server. Among these clock sources, only NITZ and NTP are up- dated without user interaction, as location services require manual activation. In this paper, we analyze security aspects of these clock sources and their impact on security features of modern smartphones. In particular, we investigate NITZ and NTP procedures over cellular networks (2G, 3G and 4G) and Wi- Fi communication respectively. Furthermore, we analyze several European, Asian, and American cellular networks from NITZ perspective. We identify three classes of vulner- abilities: specification issues in a cellular protocol, configu- rational issues in cellular network deployments, and imple- mentation issues in different mobile OS's. We demonstrate how an attacker with low cost setup can spoof NITZ and NTP messages to cause Denial of Service attacks. Finally, we propose methods for securely synchronizing the clock on smartphones.},

This paper is concerned with secure time synchronization for WSNs under message manipulation attacks. Specifically, the theoretical analysis and simulation results are first provided to demonstrate that the maximum consensus based time synchronization (MTS) protocol would be invalid under message manipulation attacks. Then, a novel secured maximum consensus based time synchronization (SMTS) protocol is proposed to detect and invalidate message manipulation attacks.

abstract = {Existing navigation services, such as GPS, offer no signal- integrity (anti-spoof) protection for the general public, especially not with systems for remote attestation of location, where an attacker has easy access to the receiver antenna. With predictable broadcast signals, the antenna can be replaced with a signal generator that simulates a sig- nal as it would be received elsewhere. With a symmetrically encrypted broadcast signal, anyone who can build or reverse engineer a receiver will know the secret key needed to spoof other receivers. Such encryp- tion is only of use in closed user communities (e.g., military) or with highly tamper-resistant modules protecting the common key. In open user communities without common secret keys, integrity protection is needed instead, with properties similar to digital signatures. The ability to verify a navigation signal must be separate from the ability to gener- ate a new one or to apply selective-delay attacks; but simply signing the broadcast signals will not protect their exact relative arrival times. This paper introduces a practical solution based on short-term information hiding.},

In this work we show that the classical durability enforc-ing mechanisms – logging, checkpointing, state transfer – can have a high impact on the performance of SMR-based services even if SSDs are used instead of disks. To alleviate this impact, we propose three techniques that can be used in a transparent manner, i.e., without modi-fying the SMR programming model or requiring extra re-sources: parallel logging, sequential checkpointing, and collaborative state transfer. We show the benefits of these techniques experimentally by implementing them in an open-source replication library, and evaluating them in the context of a consistent key-value store and a coordi-nation service.},

This paper aims to demonstrate that randomization can be a very competitive approach even in hostile environments where arbitrary faults can occur. A stack of randomized intrusion-tolerant protocols is described and its performance evaluated under several settings in both local-area-network (LAN) and wide-area-network environments. The stack provides a set of relevant services ranging from basic communication primitives up to atomic broadcast. The experimental evaluation shows that the protocols are efficient, especially in LAN environments where no performance reduction is observed under certain Byzantine faults.},

Their key envisioned uses (e.g. financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside the blockchain (e.g. stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of data requests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems. We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts and existing web sites, which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source-authenticated data to re-lying smart contracts. TC also supports confidentiality. It enables private data requests with encrypted parameters. Additionally, in a gen-eralization that executes smart-contract logic within TC, the system permits secure use of user credentials to scrape access-controlled online data sources. We describe TC's design principles and architecture and report on an implementation that uses Intel's recently in-troduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to furnish data to the Ethereum smart contract system. We formally model TC and define and prove its basic security properties in the Universal Composibility (UC) framework. Our results in-clude definitions and techniques of general interest relating to resource consumption (Ethereum's " gas " fee system) and TCB minimization.

abstract = {With the advent of unbounded small-scale dust sensors being deployed in wireless sensor networks, existing authentication protocols for ordinary wireless sensor networks are becoming less efficient for dust sensors. Resource constrained dust nodes must do anything in cooperation with other nodes. Existing key management protocols require large key storage in each node, which cannot be stored in smart dust sensor nodes with strictly limited resources. Given the practical fact that adversaries or non-adversaries cannot retrieve information inside the RAM of minute smart dust sensors, this paper presents a lightweight authentication protocol (LAP) as a key management protocol for smart dust wireless sensor networks with boundless number of nodes. The protocol uses a comparatively fewer number of keys for authentication purposes, and guarantees the security of network in the long run by a rekeying mechanism. Apart from being lightweight, it is quite primitive in the sense that it does not impose any specific requirements on the network, such as on routing and network topology.

abstract = {M2M communication is an important part of smart grid communication networks. Improved automation in smart grids results in many hetero- geneous applications based on M2M communi- cations. However, the authentication for a large number of M2M nodes in smart grids has become a challenging issue. In this article, we design a last- mile authentication scheme for AMI that utilizes smart meters to enable two-way communications between the meters and the utility. We also pres- ent a framework of M2M authentication in smart grids via a two-layer approach, that is, global and local layers. More specifically, smart meters are authenticated globally by PKI, and authenticated locally by channel signatures. The usage patterns of electricity and personal private information are distributed separately in utility and service provid- er for protecting the privacy of customers. The proposed framework helps to achieve the goals of reliable and secure M2M communications among smart meters.},

It is not too much to say that the selection and integration of appropriate cryptographic primitives into the security protocols determines the largest part of the efficiency and energy consumption of the Wireless sensor network (WSN). There are a number of surveys on security issues on WSNs, which, however, didn't focus on public-key cryptographic primitives in WSNs. In this survey, we provide a deeper understanding of public-key cryptographic primitives in WSNs including identity-based cryptography, and discuss their main directions and some open research issues that can be further pursued. We investigate state-of-the-art software implementation results of public-key cryptographic primitives in terms of execution time, energy consumption and resource occupation on constrained wireless devices choosing popular IEEE 802.15.4-compliant WSN hardware platforms, used in reallife deployments. This survey provides invaluable insights on public-key cryptographic primitives on WSN platforms, and solutions to find tradeoffs between cost, performance and security for designing security protocols in WSNs.},

In the future cyber-physical system, M2M will play a very important role in data collecting. While being a promising technology, M2M communication still faces lots of security threats. There are some security vulnerabilities that yet to be solved. In this paper, we propose a dynamic-encryption authentication scheme, by which a mobile device could be authenticated by the network and a shared one-time-password could be generated.

As traditional authentication schemes always assume the presence of a person, most authentication technologies cannot be applied in machine-centric M2M context. In this paper, we make the first attempt to formally model the authentication in M2M. We first model four attacking adversaries that can formulate all possible attacks in M2M, which are channel eavesdropping attack, credential compromise attack, function compromise attack, and ghost compromise attack. Next, we propose four models to tackle those corresponding adversaries, namely, credential-based model, machine-metrics-based model, reference-based model, and witness-based model. We also illustrate several concrete attacking methods and authentication approaches. We proof the authentication security for all proposed models and compare them for clarity. Our models present soundness and completeness in terms of authentication security, which can guide the design and analysis of concrete authentication protocols. Particularly, we construct a uniform authentication framework for M2M context and point out all possible authentication mechanisms in M2M. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wei Ren et al.},

Standard authentication mechanisms cannot prevent this attack if the adversary has compromised one or a small number of sensor nodes. In this paper, we present an interleaved hop-by-hop authentication scheme that guarantees that the base station will detect any injected false data packets when no more than a certain number t nodes are compromised. Further, our scheme provides an upper bound B for the number of hops that a false data packet could be forwarded before it is detected and dropped, given that there are up to t colluding compromised nodes. We show that in the worst case B is O(t2). Through performance analysis, we show that our scheme is efficient with respect to the security it provides, and it also allows a tradeoff between security and performance.},

Due to distributed nature of these networks and their deployment in remote areas, these networks are vulnerable to numerous security threats that can adversely affect their proper functioning. This problem is more critical if the network is deployed for some mission-critical applications such as in a tactical battlefield. Random failure of nodes is also very likely in real-life deployment scenarios. Due to resource constraints in the sensor nodes, traditional security mechanisms with large overhead of computation and communication are infeasible in WSNs. Security in sensor networks is, therefore, a particularly challenging task. This paper discusses the current state of the art in security mechanisms for WSNs. Various types of attacks are discussed and their countermeasures presented. A brief discussion on the future direction of research in WSN security is also included.},

To guarantee this protection, IoT devices are usually authenticated and the communication within the IoT network is encrypted. Therefore, it is important to have IoT devices agree keys with each other, as authenticator or encryption keys. Challenges arise from existing authentication schemes for IoT device include: firstly, pre-distributed authentication keys are not feasible; secondly, manual pairing requires excessive user effort, especially when there are a number of IoT devices; thirdly, context-based solutions are mostly peer-to-peer instead of being scalable or lack of practicality or enough security. In this paper, we propose a group audio-based authentication scheme for IoT devices (GAB-IoT), which achieves the following goals: It is group-based and scalable as the increased number of IoT devices; It is secure under a realistic threat model; It minimizes the user effort during the authentication process, therefore, strengthens the scalability and feasibility.},

abstract = {Devices in the internet of things (IoT) are frequently (i) resource-constrained, and (ii) deployed in unmonitored, phys- ically unsecured environments. Securing these devices requires tractable cryptographic protocols, as well as cost effective tamper resistance solutions. We propose and evaluate cryptographic protocols that leverage physical unclonable functions (PUFs): circuits whose input to output mapping depends on the unique characteristics of the physical hardware on which it is executed. PUF-based protocols have the benefit of minimizing private key exposure, as well as providing cost-effective tamper resistance. We present and experimentally evaluate an elliptic curve based variant of a theoretical PUF-based authentication protocol proposed previously in the literature. Our work improves over an existing proof-of-concept implementation, which relied on the discrete logarithm problem as proposed in the original work. In contrast, our construction uses elliptic curve cryptography, which substantially reduces the computational and storage burden on the device. We describe PUF-based algorithms for device enrollment, authentication, decryption, and digital signature generation. The performance of each construction is experimentally evalu- ated on a resource-constrained device to demonstrate tractability in the IoT domain. We demonstrate that our implementation achieves practical performance results, while also providing re- alistic security. Our work demonstrates that PUF-based protocols may be practically and securely deployed on low-cost resource- constrained IoT devices.},

We also give an extension that endows the solution with emergency capabilities: if a user is coerced into opening her secrets and giving the coercer full access to the device, she gives the coercer alternative secrets whose use notifies the bank of the coercion in such a way that the coercer is unable to distinguish between emergency and normal operation of the protocol.},

abstract = {Incorporating security protocols in IoT components is challenging due to their extremely constrained resources. We address this challenge by proposing a hardware-oriented lightweight authentication protocol based on device signature generated during voltage over-scaling (VOS). First, we demonstrate that VOS-based computing leaves a process variation dependent error signature in its approximate results. This error can be methodically profiled to extract information about the underlying process variation in the computation unit. We then combine this error profile with security key based authentication schemes to create a two-factor authentication mechanism. To understand the effectiveness of this protocol, we perform detailed security analysis under various attack scenarios. Finally, we simulate the authentication hardware using a process variation aware 45nm design library in HSpice. Simulation results show that our VOS-based assumptions are valid, and this authentication mechanism can withstand basic environmental variations. Overall, our approach provides a unique approach for using hardware process variations as a key for authentication.},

abstract = {Reputation systems provide mechanisms to produce a metric encapsulating reputation for a given domain for each identity within the system. These systems seek to generate an accurate assessment in the face of various factors including but not limited to unprecedented community size and potentially adversarial environments. We focus on attacks and defense mechanisms in reputation systems. We present an analysis framework that allows for the general decomposition of existing reputation systems. We classify attacks against reputation systems by identifying which system components and design choices are the targets of attacks. We survey defense mechanisms employed by existing reputation systems. Finally, we analyze several landmark systems in the peer-to-peer domain, characterizing their individual strengths and weaknesses. Our work contributes to understanding (1) which design components of reputation systems are most vulnerable, (2) what are the most appropriate defense mechanisms and (3) how these defense mechanisms can be integrated into existing or future reputation systems to make them resilient to attacks.},

abstract = {As a measure of randomness or uncertainty, the Boltzmann–Shannon entropy H has become one of the most widely used summary measures of a variety of attributes (characteristics) in different disciplines. This paper points out an often overlooked limitation of H: comparisons between differences in H-values are not valid. An alternative entropy HK is introduced as a preferred member of a new family of entropies for which difference comparisons are proved to be valid by satisfying a given value-validity condition. The HK is shown to have the appropriate properties for a randomness (uncertainty) measure, including a close linear relationship to a measurement criterion based on the Euclidean distance between probability distributions. This last point is demonstrated by means of computer generated random distributions. The results are also compared with those of another member of the entropy family. A statistical inference procedure for the entropy HK is formulated.},

abstract = {One of the promising usages of Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) is to generate cryptographic keys from PUFs for secure storage of key material. This usage has attractive properties such as physical unclonability and enhanced resistance against hardware attacks. In order to extract a reliable cryptographic key from a noisy PUF response a fuzzy extractor is used to convert non-uniform random PUF responses into nearly uniform randomness. B{\"{o}}sch et al. in 2008 proposed a fuzzy extractor suitable for efficient hardware implementation using two-stage concatenated codes, where the inner stage is a conventional error correcting code and the outer stage is a repetition code. In this paper we show that the combination of PUFs with repetition code approaches is not without risk and must be approached carefully. For example, PUFs with min-entropy lower than 66{\%} may yield zero leftover entropy in the generated key for some repetition code configurations. In addition, we find that many of the fuzzy extractor designs in the literature are too optimistic with respect to entropy estimation. For high security applications, we recommend a conservative estimation of entropy loss based on the theoretical work of fuzzy extractors and present parameters for generating 128-bit keys from memory based PUFs. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are an emerging security primitive useful for secure key storage mechanisms and anti-counterfeiting measures. To do this securely, it is imperative that PUFs are unique, i.e., possess enough entropy. The aim of this thesis is to develop and implement new methodologies to accurately estimate the entropy of PUFs. To this end, a novel method is presented which estimates the extractable entropy by calculating the mutual information between enrollment and reconstruction measurements. Furthermore, a method to determine uniqueness from the field of biometrics is modified in such a way that the entropy of PUFs can be estimated. Our newly developed entropy estimation methods are compared to other methods found in the literature using a comprehensive experimental evaluation on synthetically generated PUF data with known entropy. We find that the results from our methods are in line with results found in the literature using methods such as the context-tree weighting compression and inter-device distance tests. The contributions of our methods are that the influence of the reconstruction condition (noise) is included in the entropy estimation as well as providing insight on how entropy develops if more measurements are used during enrollment and reconstruction. We find that the extractable entropy increases as more measurements are used during enrollment and reconstruction, but only if PUF biases are reliable across conditions. Furthermore, an entropy analysis is performed on PUF data from the European Union sponsored UNIQUE project, which consists of 192 application-specific integrated circuits housing multiple instances of the most popular intrinsic PUF types. In particular, we performed a comprehensive uniqueness evaluation of four memory based PUF types: the latch, D flip-flop (DFF), buskeeper and SRAM PUF. Our analysis shows that from the four analysed PUF types, the SRAM PUF has the most extractable entropy. The buskeeper also shows strong PUF behaviour, while the DFF and latch PUF have the least extractable entropy.},

abstract = {Approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn) are mathematical algorithms created to measure the repeatability or predictability within a time series. Both algorithms are extremely sensitive to their input parameters: m (length of the data segment being compared), r (similarity criterion) and N (length of data). There is no established consensus on parameter selection in short data sets, especially for biological data. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to examine the robustness of these two entropy algorithms by exploring the effect of changing parameter values on short data sets. Data with known theoretical entropy qualities as well as experimental data from both healthy young and older adults was utilized. Our results demonstrate that both ApEn and SampEn are extremely sensitive to parameter choices, especially for very short data sets, N≤200. We suggest using N larger than 200, an m of 2 and examine several r values before selecting your parameters. Extreme caution should be used when choosing parameters for experimental studies with both algorithms. Based on our current findings, it appears that SampEn is more reliable for short data sets. SampEn was less sensitive to changes in data length and demonstrated fewer problems with relative consistency.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

abstract = {A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records, or public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction in the public ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system. Once entered, information can never be erased. The blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record of every single transaction ever made. Bitcoin, the decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency, is the most popular example that uses blockchain technology. The digital currency bitcoin itself is highly controversial but the underlying blockchain technology has worked flawlessly and found wide range of applications in both financial and non-financial world. The main hypothesis is that the blockchain establishes a system of creating a distributed consensus in the digital online world. This allows participating entities to know for certain that a digital event happened by creating an irrefutable record in a public ledger. It opens the door for developing a democratic open and scalable digital economy from a centralized one. There are tremendous opportunities in this disruptive technology, and the revolution in this space has just begun.

Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices. In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins. Our approach was exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home. In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier. Each smart home is equipped with an always online, high resource device, known as ”miner” that is responsible for handling all communication within and external to the home. The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications. We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, we present simulation results to highlight that the overheads (in terms of traffic, processing time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are insignificant relative to its security and privacy gains.},

We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts—scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.},

abstract = {The emerging Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are envi- sioned to integrate computation, communication and control with the physical world. Therefore, CPS requires close- interactions between the cyber and physical worlds both in time and space. These interactions are usually governed by events, which occur in the physical world and should autonomously be reflected in the cyber-world, and actions, which are taken by the CPS as a result of detection of events and certain decision mechanisms. Both event detection and action decision operations should be performed accurately and timely to guarantee temporal and spatial correctness. This calls for a flexible architecture and task representation framework to analyze CP operations. In this paper, we explore the temporal and spatial properties of events, define a novel CPS architecture, and develop a layered spatio- temporal event model for CPS. The event is represented as a function of attribute-based, temporal, and spatial event conditions. Moreover, logical operators are used to combine different types of event conditions to capture composite events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first event model that captures the heterogeneous characteristics of CPS for formal temporal and spatial analysis.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a dynamic global information network consisting of Internet-connected objects, such as Radio frequency identifications, sensors, actuators, as well as other instruments and smart appliances that are becoming an integral component of the future Internet. Over the last decade, we have seen a large number of the IoT solutions developed by start-ups, small and medium enterprises, large corporations, academic research institutes (such as universities), and private and public research organizations making their way into the market. In this paper, we survey over one hundred IoT smart solutions in the marketplace and examine them closely in order to identify the technologies used, functionalities, and applications. Based on the application domain, we classify and discuss these solutions under five different categories: 1) smart wearable; 2) smart home; 3) smart city; 4) smart environment; and 5) smart enterprise. This survey is intended to serve as a guideline and a conceptual framework for future research in the IoT and to motivate and inspire further developments. It also provides a systematic exploration of existing research and suggests a number of potentially significant research directions.},

abstract = {With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data, high fidelity localization and tracking systems that employ cameras, RFIDs, and attached sensors intrude on personal privacy. However, the benefit of localization information sharing enables trend forecasting and automation. To address this challenge, we introduce Wobly, an attribute based signature (ABS) that measures gait. Wobly passively receives Wi-Fi beacons and produces human signatures based on the Doppler Effect and multipath signals without attached devices and out of direct line-of-sight. Because signatures are specific to antenna placement and room configuration and do not require sensor attachments, the identities of the individuals can remain anonymous. However, the gait based signatures are still unique, and thus Wobly is able to track individuals in a building or home. Wobly uses the physical layer channel and the unique human gait as a means of encoding a person's identity. We implemented Wobly on a National Instruments Radio Frequency (RF) test bed. Using a simple naive Bayes classifier, the correct identification rate was 87{\%} with line-of-sight (LoS) and 77{\%} with non-line-of-sight (NLoS).},

abstract = {Exploiting physical layer characteristics to enhance or complement authentication strength in wireless networks has been attracting research attention recently. Existing physical layer authentication mechanisms mainly tackle single-hop communications. In this paper, we propose two physical layer challenge-response authentication mechanisms for wireless networks with relay. One mechanism, named PHY-CRAMR, is an extension of the existing PHY-CRAM protocol. It fully utilizes the randomness, reciprocity, and location decorrelation features of the wireless fading channel to hide/encrypt the challenge response messages at the physical layer, and is immune to outside attacks with a trusted relay. The other novel mechanism, named PHY-AUR, exploits randomness, coherence, and location decorrelation properties of wireless fading channel to securely convey the product of the channel state information on consecutive links and uses the fading channel to encrypt challenge and response messages. PHY-AUR is immune to both outside and inside attacks with an untrusted relay. Both PHY-CRAMR and PHY-AUR adopt OFDM technique to modulate the authentication key and challenge-response messages on subcarriers. Physical layer pilots and preambles are eliminated to prevent an attacker from gaining knowledge about the channel state information, and as a result prevent the authentication key from being revealed to untrusted attackers. We analyze the security strength of both mechanisms and conduct extensive simulations to evaluate them. It shows that both PHY-CRAMR and PHY-AUR can achieve both a high successful authentication rate and low false acceptance rate, and the performance improves as the signal to noise ratio (SNR) increases.},

abstract = {Embedded sensing systems are pervasively used in life- and security-critical systems such as those found in airplanes, automobiles, and healthcare. Traditional security mechanisms for these sensors focus on data encryption and other post-processing techniques, but the sensors themselves often remain vulnerable to attacks in the physical/analog domain. If an adversary manipulates a physical/analog signal prior to digitization, no amount of digital security mechanisms after the fact can help. Fortunately, nature imposes fundamental constraints on how these analog signals can behave. This work presents PyCRA, a physical challenge-response authentication scheme designed to protect active sensing systems against physical attacks occurring in the analog domain. PyCRA provides security for active sensors by continually challenging the surrounding environment via random but deliberate physical probes. By analyzing the responses to these probes, and by using the fact that the adversary cannot change the underlying laws of physics, we provide an authentication mechanism that not only detects malicious attacks but provides resilience against them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PyCRA through several case studies using two sensing systems: (1) magnetic sensors like those found wheel speed sensors in robotics and automotive, and (2) commercial RFID tags used in many security-critical applications. Finally, we outline methods and theoretical proofs for further enhancing the resilience of PyCRA to active attacks by means of a confusion phase---a period of low signal to noise ratio that makes it more difficult for an attacker to correctly identify and respond to PyCRA's physical challenges. In doing so, we evaluate both the robustness and the limitations of PyCRA, concluding by outlining practical considerations as well as further applications for the proposed authentication mechanism.},

The subject of statistical testing and its relation to cryptanalysis is also discussed, and some recommended statistical tests are provided. These tests may be useful as a first step in determining whether or not a generator is suitable for a particular cryptographic application.

abstract = {Indoor localization and asset tracking is an area of research which is finding increasing application in monitoring the wellbeing of elderly subjects in hospital or residential care environments. Radio frequency (RF) based localization methods tend to show poor performance in indoor environments, due to multipath scatter, and simple room-level misassociations, resulting from the relative transparency of some walls to RF waves. Ultrasound (US) localization has shown excellent room-level accuracy, and as US will not easily penetrate walls, room-level misassociations do not often occur. For normal asset tracking systems, the association between an asset and a room is not of critical importance; for clinical applications, which make inferences based on a patient and carer occupying the same room, this association is paramount. This paper outlines a proof of concept for an US-based indoor localization system with sub-room-level accuracy. The proposed design uses a US-based technique, with transmitter beacons placed throughout the environment. The subject wears the receiver module and is free to move throughout the environment. Transmission collisions are alleviated by assigning a unique prime transmission interval to each beacon; meaning the beacons do not require synchronization or coordination and operate independently of one another. Preliminary results show accurate detection at a range of over 5 m at a 0° angle and at approximately 3.5 m at an angle of 30°. Testing of two collocated transmitters, transmitting in the same plane and separated by 2.5 m results in accurate reception of both signals, even within the region of overlap.},

However, due to the resource constraints on sensors, it is infeasible to use traditional key management techniques such as public key cryptography and key distribution center (KDC). To facilitate the study of novel pairwise key predistribution techniques, this paper presents a general framework for establishing pairwise keys between sensors on the basis of a polynomial-based key predistribution protocol. This paper then presents two efficient instantiations of the general framework: a random subset assignment key predistribution scheme and a grid-based key predistribution scheme. The analysis in this paper indicates that these two schemes have a number of nice properties, including high probability (or guarantee) to establish pairwise keys, tolerance of node captures, and low communication overhead. Finally, this paper presents a technique to reduce the computation at sensors required by these schemes.},

abstract = {Neighbor discovery is a fundamental requirement and need be done frequently in underwater acoustic networks (UANs) with floating node mobility. In hostile environments, neighbor discovery is vulnerable to the wormhole attack by which the adversary uses secret wormhole links to make distant nodes falsely accept each other as neighbors. The wormhole attack may lead to many undesirable consequences and cannot be solved by cryptographic methods. Existing wormhole defenses for ground wireless networks cannot be directly applied to UANs where most of their assumptions no longer hold. This paper presents a suite of novel protocols to enable wormhole-resilient secure neighbor discovery in UANs. Our protocols are based on the Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation of acoustic signals, a basic functionality readily available in current UANs. The proposed protocols can thwart the wormhole attack with overwhelming probability without conventional hard requirements on secure and accurate time synchronization and localization. Detailed theoretical analysis and simulation results confirm the high performance of the proposed protocols. View full abstract},

These challenges call for novel architectures and protocols to ensure successful operation of the UASN. Localization is one of the fundamental tasks for UASNs which is required for data tagging, node tracking, target detection, and it can be used for improving the performance of medium access and network protocols. Recently, various UASN architectures and a large number of localization techniques have been proposed.

abstract = {Two-factor authentication protects online accounts even if passwords are leaked. Most users, however, prefer password-only authentication. One reason why two-factor authentication is so unpopular is the extra steps that the user must complete in order to log in. Currently deployed two-factor authentication mechanisms require the user to interact with his phone to, for example, copy a verification code to the browser. Two-factor authentication schemes that eliminate user-phone interaction exist, but require additional software to be deployed. In this paper we propose Sound-Proof, a usable and deployable two-factor authentication mechanism. Sound-Proof does not require interaction between the user and his phone. In Sound-Proof the second authentication factor is the proximity of the user's phone to the device being used to log in. The proximity of the two devices is verified by comparing the ambient noise recorded by their microphones. Audio recording and comparison are transparent to the user, so that the user experience is similar to the one of password-only authentication. Sound-Proof can be easily deployed as it works with current phones and major browsers without plugins. We build a prototype for both Android and iOS. We provide empirical evidence that ambient noise is a robust discriminant to determine the proximity of two devices both indoors and outdoors, and even if the phone is in a pocket or purse. We conduct a user study designed to compare the perceived usability of Sound-Proof with Google 2-Step Verification. Participants ranked Sound-Proof as more usable and the majority would be willing to use Sound-Proof even for scenarios in which two-factor authentication is optional.},

abstract = {With the advances in acoustic modem technology that enabled high-rate reliable communications, current research focuses on communication between various remote instruments within a network environment. Underwater acoustic (UWA) networks are generally formed by acoustically connected ocean-bottom sensors, autonomous underwater vehicles, and a surface station, which provides a link to an on-shore control center. While many applications require long-term monitoring of the deployment area, the battery-powered network nodes limit the lifetime of UWA networks. In addition, shallow-water acoustic channel characteristics, such as low available bandwidth, highly varying multipath, and large propagation delays, restrict the efficiency of UWA networks. Within such an environment, designing an UWA network that maximizes throughput and reliability while minimizing the power consumption becomes a very difficult task. The goal of this paper is to survey the existing network technology and its applicability to underwater acoustic channels. In addition, we present a shallow-water acoustic network example and outline some future research directions},

The existing security solutions proposed for WSN cannot be used directly in UWSN. Moreover, most of these solutions are layer wise. In this paper, we studied the threat, attack, and security issues of UWSN. Subsequently, we argue that layered security schemes cannot protect UWSN against blended attacks.

The way these data are manipulated by the sensor nodes is a fundamental issue.

NearMe com- pares clients' lists of Wi-Fi access points and signal strengths to compute the proximity of devices to one another. Traditional location sensing systems com- pute and compare absolute locations, which requires extensive a priori calibra- tion and configuration. Because we base NearMe entirely on proximity infor- mation, NearMe works “out of the box” with no calibration and minimal setup. Many “location-aware” applications only require proximity information, and not absolute location: examples include discovering nearby resources, sending an email to other persons who are nearby, or detecting synchronous user opera- tions between mobile devices. As more people use the system, NearMe grows in both the number of places that can be found (e.g. printers and conference rooms) and in the physical range over which other people and places can be found. This paper describes our algorithms and infrastructure for proximity sensing, as well as some of the clients we have implemented for various appli- cations.},

abstract = {Many mobile and wireless authentication systems are prone to relay$\backslash$nattacks whereby two non co-presence colluding entities can subvert the authentication functionality by simply relaying the data between a legitimate prover (P) and verifier (V). Examples include payment systems involving NFC and RFID devices, and zero-interaction token-based authentication approaches. Utilizing the contextual information to determine P-V proximity, or lack thereof, is a recently proposed approach to defend against relay attacks. Prior work considered WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS and Audio as different contextual modalities for the purpose of relay-resistant authentication. In this paper, we explore purely ambient physical sensing capabilities to address the problem of relay attacks in authentication systems. Specifically, we consider the use of four new sensor modalities, ambient temperature, precision gas, humidity, and altitude, for P-V proximity detection. Using an off-the-shelf ambient sensing platform, called Sensordrone, connected to Android devices, we show that combining these different modalities provides a robust proximity detection mechanism, yielding very low false positives (security against relay attacks) and$\backslash$nvery low false negatives (good usability). Such use of multiple ambient sensor modalities offers unique security advantages over traditional$\backslash$nsensors (WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS or Audio) because it requires the attacker$\backslash$nto simultaneously manipulate the multiple characteristics of the$\backslash$nphysical environment.},

People can easily access Internet application services anytime and anywhere via the hand-carried mobile devices. Most of modern mobile devices are equipped with a GPS module, which can help get the real-time location of the mobile device. In this paper, we propose a novel authentication scheme which exploits volatile passwords - One-Time Passwords (OTPs) based on the time and location information of the mobile device to transparently and securely authenticate users while accessing Internet services, such as online banking services and e-commerce transactions. Compared to a permanent password base scheme, an OTP based one can prevent users from being eavesdropped. In addition to a memoryless feature, the scheme restricts the validness of the OTP password not only in a certain time period but also in a tolerant geometric region to increase the security protection. However, if a legitimate user is not in the anticipated tolerant region, the user may fail to be authenticated. Hence, a Short Message Service (SMS) based mutual authentication mechanism is also proposed in the article to supplement the unexpected misjudgement. The proposed method with a volatile time/location-based password features more secure and more convenient for user authentication.},

Users are able to securely pair their personal devices with previously unknown devices by simply placing them close to each other (e.g., users can pair their phones by just bringing them into proximity). Ensemble leverages a user's growing collection of trusted devices, such as phones, music players, computers and personal sensors to observe transmissions made by pairing devices. These devices analyze variations in received signal strength (RSS) in order to determine whether the pairing devices are in physical proximity to each other. We show that, while individual trusted devices can not properly distinguish proximity in all cases, a collection of trusted devices can do so reliably. Our Ensemble prototype extends Diffie-Hellman key exchange with proximity-based authentication. Our experiments show that an Ensemble-enabled collection of Nokia N800 Internet Tablets can detect devices in close proximity and can reliably detect attackers as close as two meters away.},

If an anomaly is detected, this kind of schemes will require the user for validation (i.e., input correct PIN). In this paper, we first propose a lightweight touch-dynamics-based user authentication scheme on a touchscreen mobile phone, which consists of only 8 touch-gesture related features. In addition, we further design an adaptive mechanism that can periodically select a better classifier to maintain the authentication accuracy during user authentication. As a study, we implement a cost-based metric that enables this mechanism to choose a less costly classifier. In the evaluation, the experimental results of involving 50 participants indicate that our proposed user authentication scheme can achieve an average error rate of 2.46{\%} and that the adaptive mechanism can maintain the authentication accuracy at a relatively stable level.},

abstract = {A process which ensures person authentication information by processing unique feature vectors, which were fetched from human inimitable characteristics, is known as unimodal biometric system (UBS). Though these systems provide a very good result, they fail in certain conditions such as noisy acquisition, missing out of unique human characteristics etc. There is need for robust biometric system. Current smart electronic devices capture and process enormous amount of data and execute results in less time. This paper presents past research and development in the field of biometric technology. It also describes major technological perspective and fundamental progress in unimodal and multimodal biometric system. Also, it reviews the modalities of biometric system, biometric classification methods, past experimental results, merits and demerits of unimodal system. It describes the integration scenario of multimodal biometrics. The objective of this review paper is to summarize past and current trends, and it conclude with the decision on future direction for developing proficiency in the field of person authentication biometric technology.},

All three notions – that is, non-linear dynamics, complexity and randomness – have a rich conceptual, modelling or analytic tradition in core areas of economic theory, both at the micro and macro levels. It is the algorithmic foundation I try to provide for them that could be considered the novel contribution in this paper.

abstract = {The SMLsystem is a house built at the Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera (CEU-UCH) to participate in the Solar Decathlon 2012 competition. Several technologies have been integrated to reduce power consumption. A predictive module, based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), has been developed using data acquired in Valencia. The module produces short-term forecast of indoor temperature, using as input data captured by a complex monitoring system. The system expects to reduce the power consumption related to Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, due to the following assumptions: the high power consumption for which HVAC is responsible (53.9{\%} of the overall consumption); and the energy needed to maintain temperature is less than the energy required to lower/increase it. This paper studies the development viability of predictive systems for a totally unknown environment applying on-line learning techniques. The model parameters are estimated starting from a totally random model or from an unbiased a priori knowledge. These forecasting measures could allow the house to adapt itself to future temperature conditions by using home automation in an energy-efficient manner. Experimental results show reasonable forecasting accuracy with simple models, and in relatively short training time (4–5 days).},

abstract = {We investigate the foundations of Physical Unclonable Functions from several perspectives. Firstly, we discuss formal and conceptual issues in the various current definitions of PUFs. As we argue, they have the effect that many PUF candidates formally meet no existing definition. Next, we present alternative definitions and a new formalism. It avoids asymptotic concepts like polynomial time, but is based on concrete time bounds and on the concept of a security experiment. The formalism splits the notion of a PUF into two new notions, Strong t-PUFs and Obfuscating t-PUFs. Then, we provide a comparative analysis between the existing definitions and our new notions, by classifying existing PUF implementations with respect to them. In this process, we use several new and unpublished machine learning results. The outcome of this comparative classification is that our definitions seem to match the current PUF landscape well, perhaps better than previous definitions. Finally, we analyze the security and practicality features of Strong and Obfuscating t-PUFs in concrete applications, obtaining further justification for the split into two notions.},

abstract = {We present Heart-to-Heart (H2H), a system to authenticate external medical device controllers and programmers to Implantable Medi- cal Devices (IMDs). IMDs, which include pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators, are therapeutic medical devices partially or wholly embedded in the human body. They often have built-in radio com- munication to facilitate non-invasive reprogramming and data read- out. Many IMDs, though, lack well designed authentication proto- cols, exposing patients to over-the-air attack and physical harm. H2H makes use of ECG (heartbeat data) as an authentication mechanism, ensuring access only by a medical instrument in phys- ical contact with an IMD-bearing patient. Based on statistical anal- ysis of real-world data, we propose and analyze new techniques for extracting time-varying randomness from ECG signals for use in H2H. We introduce a novel cryptographic device pairing proto- col that uses this randomness to protect against attacks by active adversaries, while meeting the practical challenges of lightweight implementation and noise tolerance in ECG readings. Finally, we describe an end-to-end implementation in an ARM-Cortex M-3 mi- crocontroller that demonstrates the practicality of H2H in current IMD hardware. Previous schemes have had goals much like those of H2H, but with serious limitations making them unfit for deployment—such as na{\"{i}}vely designed cryptographic pairing protocols (some of them recently broken). In addition to its novel analysis and use of ECG entropy, H2H is the first physiologically-based IMD device pairing protocol with a rigorous adversarial model and protocol analysis.},

The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},

The group authentication is specially designed for group-oriented applications. The group authentication is no longer a one-to-one type of authentication as most conventional user authentication schemes which have one prover and one verifier; but, it is a many-to-many type of authentication which has multiple provers and multiple verifiers. We propose a basic t-secure m-user n-group authentication scheme ((t, m, n) GAS), where t is the threshold of the proposed scheme, m is the number of users participated in the group authentication, and n is the number of members of the group, which is based on Shamir's (t, n) secret sharing (SS) scheme. The basic scheme can only work properly in synchronous communications. We also propose asynchronous (t, m, n) GASs, one is a GAS with one-time authentication and the other is a GAS with multiple authentications. The (t, m, n) GAS is very efficient since it is sufficient to authenticate all users at once if all users are group members; however, if there are nonmembers, it can be used as a preprocess before applying conventional user authentication to identify nonmembers.},

abstract = {Medical devices equipped with network interfaces, classified as sensors, transmit sen- sitive information through the network and form a sensor network. This network can be used to monitor patients at home remotely. The information from these sensors is vulner- able and requires strong security mechanisms. Because of vulnerabilities, more effective authentication methods have been developed. However, the current authentication solu- tions require direct interaction of the user with the system, which does not respect their individuality. Thus, this dissertation proposes a strong authentication solution in which the interaction of the user with the system is removed based on biometrics and location factors. The developed authenticator was tested through different case studies to show its efficiency and feasibility before application in a real environment.},

This paper aims to expand on the ideas of what such an attacker could do to influence the behavior of the vehicle after that type of attack. In particular, we demonstrate how on two different vehicles that in some circumstances we are able to control the steering, braking, acceleration and display. We also propose a mechanism to detect these kinds of attacks.

abstract = {We demonstrate relay attacks on Passive Keyless Entry and Start (PKES) systems used in modern cars. We build two efficient and inexpensive attack realizations, wired and wireless physical-layer relays, that allow the attacker to enter and start a car by relaying messages between the car and the smart key. Our relays are completely independent of the modulation, protocol, or presence of strong authentication and encryption. We perform an extensive evaluation on 10 car models from 8 manufacturers. Our results show that relaying the signal in one direction only (from the car to the key) is sufficient to perform the attack while the true distance between the key and car remains large (tested up to 50 meters, non line-of-sight). We also show that, with our setup, the smart key can be excited from up to 8 meters. This removes the need for the attacker to get close to the key in order to establish the relay. We further analyze and discuss critical system characteristics. Given the generality of the relay attack and the number of evaluated systems, it is likely that all PKES systems based on similar designs are also vulnerable to the same attack. Finally, we propose immediate mitigation measures that minimize the risk of relay attacks as well as recent solutions that may prevent relay attacks while preserving the convenience of use, for which PKES systems were initially introduced.},

abstract = {Wireless networks are being integrated into the modern automobile. The security and privacy implications of such in-car networks, however, have are not well understood as their transmissions propagate beyond the con- nes of a car's body. To understand the risks associated with these wireless systems, this paper presents a privacy and security evaluation of wireless Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems using both laboratory experiments with isolated tire pressure sensor modules and experiments with a complete vehicle system. We show that eavesdropping is easily possible at a distance of roughly 40m from a passing vehicle. Further, reverse-engineering of the underlying protocols revealed static 32 bit identi- ers and that messages can be easily triggered remotely, which raises privacy concerns as vehicles can be tracked through these identiers. Further, current protocols do not employ authentication and vehicle implementations do not perform basic input validation, thereby allowing for remote spoong of sensor messages. We validated this experimentally by triggering tire pressure warning messages in a moving vehicle from a customized software radio attack platform located in a nearby vehicle. Finally, the paper concludes with a set of recommendations for improving the privacy and security of tire pressure monitoring systems and other forthcoming in-car wireless sensor networks.},

In this article we argue that new security paradigms which exploit physical layer properties of the wireless medium, such as the rapid spatial, spectral, and temporal decorrelation properties of the radio channel, can enhance confidentiality and authentication services. We outline some basic constructions for these services, and then provide a case study for how such strategies can be integrated into a broader security framework for a wireless network.},

With increasingly sophisticated technology advancements the dimensions of the devices are getting smaller, and the computing capabilities are now almost on par with the PC in the past two to three years. Based on those abilities the device can be paired with other components such as wireless communication technology, sensors and other supporting components to determine the state of the environment, or actuators as well to give response. Because all of these things take place in the digital world, there arose a discourse what if the digital world were to be combined with the physical world. A system that combines the capabilities of computing, communications and data storage, in order to monitor or control the entities that exist in the physical are world called Cyber Physical Systems.

Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general-purpose computing. This report examines the potential technical obstacles impeding progress, and in particular raises the question of whether today's computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.},

abstract = {The increase of online services, such as eBanks, WebMails, in which users are verified by a username and password, is increasingly exploited by identity theft procedures. Identity Theft is a fraud, in which someone pretends to be someone else is order to steal money or get other benefits. To overcome the problem of identity Theft an additional security layer is required. Within the last decades the option of verifying users based on their keystroke dynamics was proposed during login verification. Thus, the imposter has to be able to type in a similar way to the real user in addition to having the username and password. However, verifying users upon login is not enough, since a logged station/mobile is vulnerable for imposters when the user leaves her machine. Thus, verifying users continuously based on their activities is required. Within the last decade there is a growing interest and use of biometrics tools, however, these are often costly and require additional hardware. Behavioral biometrics, in which users are verified, based on their keyboard and mouse activities, present potentially a good solution. In this paper we discuss the problem of identity theft and propose behavioral biometrics as a solution. We survey existing studies and list the challenges and propose solutions.},

abstract = {Mobile devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated and now incorporate many diverse and powerful sensors. The latest generation of smart phones is especially laden with sensors, including GPS sensors, vision sensors (cameras), audio sensors (microphones), light sensors, temperature sensors, direction sensors (compasses), and acceleration sensors. In this paper we describe and evaluate a system that uses phone-based acceleration sensors, called accelerometers, to identify and authenticate cell phone users. This form of behavioral biométrie identification is possible because a person's movements form a unique signature and this is reflected in the accelerometer data that they generate. To implement our system we collected accelerometer data from thirty-six users as they performed normal daily activities such as walking, jogging, and climbing stairs, aggregated this time series data into examples, and then applied standard classification algorithms to the resulting data to generate predictive models. These models either predict the identity of the individual from the set of thirty-six users, a task we call user identification, or predict whether (or not) the user is a specific user, a task we call user authentication. This work is notable because it enables identification and authentication to occur unobtrusively, without the users taking any extra actions-all they need to do is carry their cell phones. There are many uses for this work. For example, in environments where sharing may take place, our work can be used to automatically customize a mobile device to a user. It can also be used to provide device security by enabling usage for only specific users and can provide an extra level of identity verification.},

The recognition of the performed activity is based on Radon transforms that are applied on spatiotemporal motion templates. User authentication is performed exploiting the behavioural variations between different users. The upper body limb anthropometric information is extracted for each user and an attributed body-related graph structure framework is employed for the detection of static biometric features of substantial discrimination power. Finally, a quality factor based on ergonomic criteria evaluates the recognition capacity of each activity. Experimental validation illustrates that the proposed approach for integrating static anthropometric features and activity-related recognition advances significantly the authentication performance.},

abstract = {Traffic crashes on urban freeways account for thousands of lives lost and billions of dollars wasted every year in America. Previous research has shown that certain freeway conditions are more susceptible to crashes occurring than others. These conditions are said to have a high crash potential. The purpose of this research is to test the effects of intelligent transportation system (ITS) strategies on reducing the potential for crashes to occur on a major urban freeway. In this research, Interstate-4 in Orlando, Florida was simulated using the PARAMICS micro-simulation software package. The crash potential was then determined through models that were created in the previous research conducted by Abdel-Aty et al. (2005) using logistic regression to associate traffic characteristics with the risk of a crash occurring. Several mitigation strategies were used while simulating the freeway and the crash potential was determined for each technique. The before (pre-ITS) and after case were then compared to examine the effects of the crash mitigation methods. The results of this research show that variable speed limits (VSL) have a positive effect on lowering the crash potential during high-speed conditions. VSL does not affect the low-speed case but if ramp metering is instead implemented the potential for a significant reduction in the crash potential is realized. However, there are still more strategies that need to be tested including route diversion, lane change restrictions, and feedback controlled ramp metering},

These days the Swede rigging up plenty of Fords for crash tests. Ford owns the prestigious Volvo, Jaguar, and Aston Martin car companies, and has made Sweden its center of excellence for vehicle safety testing. There's a good reason why the second-largest US car maker has ceded this area of expertise to a non-US supplier: few auto companies have won as many awards for car safety as Volvo. This article discusses safety testing of cars at Volvo using virtual crashes and real crashes. The unique features of the test facilities are briefly outlined including the two intersecting test tracks: a 154-meter fixed track and an 80-meter movable one that can be turned as much as 90 degrees. Front and side collisions can thus be tested at virtually all angles. If the back door at the end of the movable track is opened, cars can be sent flying directly into the rocky hillside outside. For so-called barrier tests, a single car on the fixed track hurtles into an 850-ton block at the far end.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, occupant restraint systems for automobiles have made considerable progress globally. There has been a tremendous increase in the complexity and sophistication of functional requirements. Particularly significant in the overall evolution of restraint systems is the growth in electronics content, which is concurrent with similar phenomena in the automotive world, as well as in many other technology-related fields. In conjunction with this trend, the shift to digital components and subsystems expanded, while the design of restraint systems has become more diversified with enhanced adaptability and flexibility. In addition to the airbags that are standardized for passenger vehicles, there has been a whole spectrum of emerging safety features that provide additional safety improvements. For example, rollover and occupant sensing are being added onto an integrated occupant protection system. Global positioning systems are coupled with crash sensors into emergency notification services. Increasingly, vehicles are now being equipped with active safety systems. The availability of both passive restraints and active safety functions will allow an additional layer of synergistic integration across safety systems. Research and developments in vehicular safety can be expected to remain active in the foreseeable future. This paper describes the system-level design trends that have occurred in the past and offers a perspective of future design transition in automotive restraint systems},

Indoor wireless positioning is the key technology to enable location based services to work well indoors, where GPS normally could not work. Bluetooth has been widely used in mobile devices like phone, PAD etc. therefore Bluetooth based indoor positioning has great market potential. Radio Signal Strength (RSS) is a key parameter for wireless positioning. New Bluetooth standard (since version 2.1) enables RSS to be discovered without time consuming pre-connection. In this research, general wireless positioning technologies are firstly analysed. Then RSS based Bluetooth positioning using the new feature is studied. The mathematical model is established to analyse the relation between RSS and the distance between two Bluetooth devices. Three distance-based algorithms are used for Bluetooth positioning: Least Square Estimation, Three-border and Centroid Method. Comparison results are analysed and the ways to improve the positioning accuracy are discussed.},

We evaluate uWave using a large gesture library with over 4000 samples for eight gesture patterns collected from eight users over one month. uWave achieves 98.6{\%} accuracy, competitive with statistical methods that require significantly more training samples. We also present applications of uWave in gesture-based user authentication and interaction with 3D mobile user interfaces.

abstract = {With fast development in high performance computer area and modeling techniques, design of injury countermeasures based on numerical simulations could make the process more cost-efficient. To reduce the risks and uncertainties associated with the use of predictive models for design decision making, an increased attention should be paid to the validation process of human dummy models. The main goal of this study was to assess a numerical THOR dummy model in frontal crash environment using kinetic and kinematic test data and various validation metrics. A THOR-NT dummy positioned on a rigid planar seat and restrained by a standard 3-point shoulder and lap belt system was subjected to two frontal crash sled tests with “initial velocity 40 km/h”. In the numerical analysis, the dummy model was positioned in a test setup model using the same procedure employed in testing. The dynamic and kinematic data of dummy model were compared with corresponding test data using validation metrics implemented in two rating systems. The overall dummy kinematics, the 3D displacement time histories of certain dummy body regions, and the interaction forces of dummy with the sled and the belt obtained in simulation were in reasonable agreement with the corresponding test data. Generally, the rating scores showed to be sensitive to the validation metrics and to the weighting factors used in the assessment process. The current average score of THOR model positioned it in the “fair-to-acceptable” range, which would recommend it for use in impact simulations. The results of this study and the validation methodology may be used for further refinement of the current THOR model, in setting up future dummy tests, the assessment of other human dummy models, and the improvement of model rating methods.},

After a state-of-the-art overview of IT security in vehicles, we give a short intro- duction into cryptographic terminology and functionality. This contributionwill then identify the need for automotive IT security while presenting typical attacks, resulting security objectives, and characteristic constraints within the automotive area. We will introduce core security technologies and relevant securitymechanisms followed by a detailed description of critical vehicular ap- plications, business models, and components relying on IT security.We conclude our contributionwith a detailed statement about challenges and opportunities for the automotive IT community for embedding IT security in vehicles.},

@article{Caveney2010,
abstract = {The past decade witnessed active safety systems such as vehicle stability control (VSC) rapidly change the automotive electronic landscape by complementing passive safety systems such as seat belts and air bags. Most automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) offer laser-based or radar-based adaptive cruise control (ACC) or precrash systems (PCSs). ACC employs forward-looking sensors for longitudinal control of the vehicle through brake and throttle actuation. PCSs additionally utilize rear-looking sensors and driver-recognition cameras to prepare the vehicle's cabin for an imminent collision by seat belt pretensioning and head-restraint repositioning. Similarly, OEMs are releasing lateral control systems such as lane-keeping assistants (LKAs) or lane-departure warnings (LDWs), which use computer vision to detect the vehicle's orientation relative to lane markings and provide feedback to the driver through audible, visual, or haptic signals.},

abstract = {Every two minutes a car occupant was involved in an accident, every two hours a road death happened, every 13 hours a pedestrian was killed and every 19 hours a cyclist died - these were the tragic statistic of accidents on Germany's roads in 2009 [10]. Networking and integrating active as well as passive vehicle safety systems constitutes an important approach to reduce the number of road deaths to zero (Vision Zero campaign [13]). Therefore special tools for developing and testing such integrated and networked automotive safety systems have to be devised. This paper points out one attempt at a solution: developing an integrated tool environment consisting of a Model-in-the-Loop, a Software-in-the-Loop and a real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop system containing a crash simulation based on real and simulated crash data as well as vehicle simulation. It also includes a fail-safe tester to be able to test the physical errors. With such a system, the development and test of new integrated safety systems will be facilitated and missed failures can be diminished. This paper describes the challenges in developing such a highly integrated and complex tool.},

In our implementation the proposed system receive the input signals from three types of sensors: accelerometers, displacement sensors and angular velocity sensors. The system is composed by a conditioning unit and a multichannel data acquisition board (NI 6251) connected to a computer through USB interface. The conditioning circuit of the system ensures the variable amplification, filtering and sample and hold function for the signals received from the sensors. The sampling frequency used in the system is 40 kHz, simultaneously for all three input channels. Also, for graphical displaying and further processing of measured data, a proprietary software application was developed in LabVIEW programming environment. By using a compact realization of the conditioning unit, a high speed data acquisition board and an attractive graphical interface is obtained a flexible system for accurate collision test in automotive industry. The system can be extended very easy by increasing the number of attached sensors and minor changes in the software application.},

abstract = {Mobile computing and sensing technologies present exciting opportunities for healthcare. Prescription wireless sensors worn by patients can automatically deliver medical data to care providers, dramatically improving their ability to diagnose, monitor, and manage a range of medical conditions. Using the mobile phones that patients already carry to provide connectivity between sensors and providers is essential to keeping costs low and deployments simple. Unfortunately, software-based attacks against phones are also on the rise, and successful attacks on privacy-sensitive and safety-critical applications can have significant consequences for patients. In this paper, we describe Plug-n-Trust (PnT), a novel ap- proach to protecting both the confidentiality and integrity of safety-critical medical sensing and data processing on vulnerable mobile phones. With PnT, a plug-in smart card provides a trusted computing environment, keeping data safe even on a compromised mobile phone. By design, PnT is simple to use and deploy, while providing a flexible programming interface amenable to a wide range of applications. We describe our implementation, designed for Java-based smart cards and Android phones, in which we use a split-computation model with a novel path hashing technique to verify proper behavior without exposing confidential data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that PnT achieves its security goals while incurring acceptable overhead.},

Since most cyber attacks happen in erratic ways, it is difficult to describe them systematically. In this paper, instead of identifying a specific cyber attack model, we are focused on analyzing the system's response during cyber attacks. Deception attacks (or false data injection attacks), which are performed by tampering with system components or data, are not of particular concern if they can be easily detected by the system's monitoring system. However, intelligent cyber attackers can avoid being detected by the monitoring system by carefully design cyber attacks. Our main objective is to investigate the performance of such stealthy deception attacks from the system's perspective. We investigate three kinds of stealthy deception attacks according to the attacker's ability to compromise the system. Based on the information about the dynamics of the system and existing hypothesis testing algorithms, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the attacker could perform each kind of attack without being detected. In the end, we illustrate the threat of these cyber attacks using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation example.},

This individual security design leads to several problems: combining several functions that are for its own secure may not result in a secure system. Furthermore, the combination of functions might also lead to situations, where mechanisms erroneously detect a security threat. This paper argues that new features, such as Car-2-Car communication or autonomous driving, will result in new information and communication technology (ICT) architectures of cars. The paper will outline basic properties of this architecture and summarize resulting security threads. We will argue that security needs to be treated in a holistic way and that the design must be suitable for adaptive, multiple independent levels of security (MILS) architecture.},

While the first focus was on security issues related to inter-vehicle communication, the Intelligent Transport System (ITS) community rapidly realized that in-vehicle security, which means secure communication endpoints, is also required to enable secure communication between cars and their environment. The recent successful hacking of automotive systems has strengthened this position. However, the holistic view required to set up a framework for mutual trust-establishment between the involving communication entities is missing. The reception of an authentic message does not provide sufficient proof of the trustworthiness of the message without additional trust assurance regarding the message's sender and the sender's platform integrity. Hence, the need to attest/certify the trustworthiness of a remote communication partner's platform is arising. In this paper, we analyze the platform security requirements of V2X systems, define different Trust Assurance Levels (TAL) and propose a certification framework to support trust establishment between involved V2X communication partners.},

abstract = {An upcoming trend for automotive manufacturers is to perform remote diagnostics and firmware updates over the air, which allows identifying hardware problems and correction of software flaws with minimal customer inconvenience. These procedures require that the previously isolated in-vehicle network permits external communication, which introduces a number of security risks, e.g., cyber attack threats. In this paper, we identify cyber attack threats and classify the electronic control units (ECUs) in the in-vehicle network to assist in determining which ones to protect and restrict access to. We divide the ECUs into five categories: powertrain, vehicle safety, comfort, infotainment, and telematics. We then use four safety integrity levels to classify the ECU categories. Moreover, we define safety effect levels of security threats which are used to classify identified attacks in the remote diagnostics and firmware updates over the air procedures. The safety and security levels are combined to classify the ECU categories. From the results we conclude that ECU categories such as powertrain and vehicle safety require further protection prior to introducing remote connectivity. As a conclusion, we suggest that automotive manufacturers should emphasize security or restrict the remote diagnostics and firmware updates over the air procedures to certain ECUs.},

@article{Yagan2012,
abstract = {We consider a cyber-physical system consisting of two interacting networks, i.e., a cyber-network overlaying a physical-network. It is envisioned that these systems are more vulnerable to attacks since node failures in one network may result in (due to the interdependence) failures in the other network, causing a cascade of failures that would potentially lead to the collapse of the entire infrastructure. The robustness of interdependent systems against this sort of catastrophic failure hinges heavily on the allocation of the (interconnecting) links that connect nodes in one network to nodes in the other network. In this paper, we characterize the optimum inter-link allocation strategy against random attacks in the case where the topology of each individual network is unknown. In particular, we analyze the “regular” allocation strategy that allots exactly the same number of bi-directional inter-network links to all nodes in the system. We show, both analytically and experimentally, that this strategy yields better performance (from a network resilience perspective) compared to all possible strategies, including strategies using random allocation, unidirectional inter-links, etc. Keywords:},

abstract = {In Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), computer systems are invisible, but they are embedded in real-world entities, which are monitored and controlled. A key challenge of CPS is to assure high reliability in a scalable and dynamic computing environment in the presence of frequent data propagation among CPS nodes. To effectively manage such data delivery, CPS may need a data-centric middleware, such as the Data Distribution Service (DDS) specification, which makes it easy to deal with complicated data distribution. To support higher reliability, mission-critical CPS applications are often required to provide service even during code modification. Therefore, Dynamic Software Updates (DSU) can be effectively applied for the CPS applications. This paper presents a dynamically updating approach for DDS-centric CPS applications. The proposed approach consists of the following steps: (1) to publish update requests, (2) to subscribe to the interesting update requests, (3) to discover the CPS nodes with the new version of an updated file, and (4) to perform the updates. Our initial results indicate that DSU techniques can be applied to CPS applications, which are required to support high reliability and seamless service.},

abstract = {Most large scale traffic information systems rely on fixed sensors (e.g. loop detectors, cameras) and user generated data, this latter in the form of GPS traces sent by smartphones or GPS devices onboard vehicles. While this type of data is relatively inexpensive to gather, it can pose multiple security and privacy risks, even if the location tracks are anonymous. In particular, creating bogus location tracks and sending them to the system is relatively easy. This bogus data could perturb traffic flow estimates, and disrupt the transportation system whenever these estimates are used for actuation. In this article, we propose a new framework for solving a variety of privacy and cybersecurity problems arising in transportation systems. The state of traffic is modeled by the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards traffic flow model, which is a first order scalar conservation law with concave flux function. Given a set of traffic flow data, we show that the constraints resulting from this partial differential equation are mixed integer linear inequalities for some decision variable. The resulting framework is very flexible, and can in particular be used to detect spoofing attacks in real time, or carry out attacks on location tracks. Numerical implementations are performed on experimental data from the{\~{}}$\backslash$emph{\{}Mobile Century{\}} experiment to validate this framework.},

abstract = {Embedded systems, particularly real-time systems with temporal constraints, are increasingly deployed in every day life. Such systems that interact with the physical world are also referred to as cyber-physical systems (CPS). These systems commonly find use in critical infrastructure from transportation to health care. While security in CPS-based real-time embedded systems has been an afterthought, it is becoming a critical issue as these systems are increasingly networked and inter-dependent. The advancement in their functionality has resulted in more conspicuous interfaces that may be exploited to attack them. In this paper, we present three mechanisms for time-based intrusion detection. More specifically, we detect the execution of unauthorized instructions in real-time CPS environments. Such intrusion detection utilizes information obtained by static timing analysis. For real-time CPS systems, timing bounds on code sections are readily available as they are already determined prior to the schedulability analysis. We demonstrate how to provide micro-timings for multiple granularity levels of application code. Through bounds checking of these micro-timings, we develop techniques to detect intrusions (1) in a self-checking manner by the application and (2) through the operating system scheduler, which are novel contributions to the real-time/embedded systems domain to the best of our knowledge.},

We develop models for an intelligent speed adaptation that respects variable speed limit control and incident management. We identify safe ranges for crucial design parameters in these systems and, using the theorem prover KeYmaera, formally verify safety of the resulting CPS models. Finally, we show how those parameter ranges can be used to decide trade-offs for practical system implementations even for design parameters that are not modeled formally},

Our key exchange protocol also extends to support group signature schemes instead of DAA.

A particular issue with fully anonymous authentication schemes is that users cannot easily be prevented from copying and sharing credentials. In this paper, we propose an anonymous authentication scheme for mobile devices that prevents copying and sharing of credentials based on hardware security features. Our system is an optimized adaptation of an existing direct anonymous attestation (DAA) scheme, specifically designed for resource-constrained mobile devices. Our solution provides (i) anonymity and untraceability of mobile embedded devices against service providers, (ii) secure device authentication even against collusions of malicious service providers, and (iii) allows for revocation of authentication credentials. We present a new cryptographic scheme with a proof of security, as well as an implementation on ARM TrustZone. Moreover, we evaluate the efficiency of our approach and demonstrate its suitability for mobile devices.},

If network coding is used, vehicles have much more flexibility in content sharing and the system stability and scalability are promoted also in presence of mobility. Along this line, we propose an efficient mechanism to provide secrecy of the information. Traditional approaches based on encryption decrease the cooperation willingness of intermediate nodes, which have no expectation of recovering the file. Our scheme is based on obfuscation by processing and polluting the original file so that only the intended recipients, informed of corrupted blocks, can recover the information timely. We present several alternatives to efficiently provide weak secrecy and to foster cooperation. We simulate the file distribution in a vehicular network and show that the proposed scheme enhances content distribution in term of downloading speed and it is much more efficient than the ones that use encryption.},

However, fixed keys allow an eavesdropper to associate a key with a vehicle and a location, violating drivers' privacy. In this work we propose a VANET key management scheme based on temporary anonymous certified keys (TACKs). Our scheme efficiently prevents eavesdroppers from linking a vehicle's different keys and provides timely revocation of misbehaving participants while maintaining the same or less overhead for vehicle-to-vehicle communication as the current IEEE 1609.2 standard for VANET security.},

abstract = {We present a generic yet practical framework for assessing security risks to cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Our framework can be used to benchmark security risks when information is less than perfect, and interdependencies of physical and computational components may result in correlated failures. Such environments are prone to externalities, and can cause huge societal losses. We focus on the risks that arise from interdependent reliability failures (faults) and security failures (attacks). We advocate that a sound assessment of these risks requires explicit modeling of the effects of both technology-based defenses and institutions necessary for supporting them. Thus, we consider technology-based security defenses grounded in information security tools and fault-tolerant control in conjunction with institutional structures. Our game-theoretic approach to estimating security risks facilitates more effective defenses, especially against correlated failures.},

Thanks to technological advances, these infrastructures have become increasingly dependent on one another and have emerged as interdependent networks. While interdependency enables to build systems that are larger, smarter and more complex, it is also observed that interdependent systems tend to be more fragile against failures, natural hazards and attacks. It is therefore of vital importance to develop the science for interdependent Networks, which serves as the foundation to better understand the interplays among individual networks and propel significant advances therein, such as the Internet, power grid, social networks, the financial system and the economy to name just a few.

Since CVS is a safety system, situation awareness has to be real-time with high accuracy. Cooperation in the context of CVS is achieved through vehicular networks that are tuned to the purpose of vehicle state tracking in a neighborhood around each vehicle. In this paper, we describe different methodologies in approaching the design of CVS, and propose a systematic Cyber-Physical Systems approach to the design of CVS. Our proposed approach is to design the system in a top-down manner, by identifying system metrics such as approximate measures of awareness, and then characterizing component models and their interactions. For this purpose, processes that handle vehicle state estimation and dissemination of state information are studied and their interactions are modeled in order to derive an overall awareness quality metric. The result of analyzing and modeling such effects is then used in studying the design of adaptive control schemes for each component of CVS.},

abstract = {It is often appealing to assume that existing solutions can be directly applied to emerging engineering do- mains. Unfortunately, careful investigation of the unique chal- lenges presented by new domains exposes its idiosyncrasies, thus often requiring new approaches and solutions. In this paper, we argue that the Bsmart[ grid, replacing its incredibly successful and reliable predecessor, poses a series of new se- curity challenges, among others, that require novel approaches to the field of cyber security. We will call this new field cyber– physical security. The tight coupling between information and communication technologies and physical systems introduces new security concerns, requiring a rethinking of the commonly used objectives and methods. Existing security approaches are either inapplicable, not viable, insufficiently scalable, incom- patible, or simply inadequate to address the challenges posed by highly complex environments such as the smart grid. A con- certed effort by the entire industry, the research community, and the policy makers is required to achieve the vision of a secure smart grid infrastructure.},

abstract = {The growing dependence of critical infrastructures and industrial automation on interconnected physical and cyber-based control systems has resulted in a growing and previously unforeseen cyber security threat to supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and distributed control systems (DCSs). It is critical that engineers and managers understand these issues and know how to locate the information they need. This paper provides a broad overview of cyber security and risk assessment for SCADA and DCS, introduces the main industry organizations and government groups working in this area, and gives a comprehensive review of the literature to date. Major concepts related to the risk assessment methods are introduced with references cited for more detail. Included are risk assessment methods such as HHM, IIM, and RFRM which have been applied successfully to SCADA systems with many interdependencies and have highlighted the need for quantifiable metrics. Presented in broad terms is probability risk analysis (PRA) which includes methods such as FTA, ETA, and FEMA. The paper concludes with a general discussion of two recent methods (one based on compromise graphs and one on augmented vulnerability trees) that quantitatively determine the probability of an attack, the impact of the attack, and the reduction in risk associated with a particular countermeasure.},

@techreport{Kisner2010,
abstract = {Critical infrastructure sites and facilities are becoming increasingly dependent on interconnected physical and cyber-based real-time distributed control systems (RTDCSs). A mounting cybersecurity threat results from the nature of these ubiquitous and sometimes unrestrained communications interconnections. Much work is under way in numerous organizations to characterize the cyber threat, determine means to minimize risk, and develop mitigation strategies to address potential consequences. While it seems natural that a simple application of cyber-protection methods derived from corporate business information technology (IT) domain would lead to an acceptable solution, the reality is that the characteristics of RTDCSs make many of those methods inadequate and unsatisfactory or even harmful. A solution lies in developing a defense-in-depth approach that ranges from protection at communications interconnect levels ultimately to the control system's functional characteristics that are designed to maintain control in the face of malicious intrusion. This paper summarizes the nature of RTDCSs from a cybersecurity perspective and discusses issues, vulnerabilities, candidate mitigation approaches, and metrics.},

abstract = {In the last years there has been an increasing interest in the security of process control and SCADA systems. Furthermore, recent computer attacks such as the Stuxnet worm, have shown there are parties with the motivation and resources to effectively attack control systems. While previous work has proposed new security mechanisms for control systems, few of them have explored new and fundamentally different research problems for securing control systems when compared to securing traditional information technology (IT) systems. In particular, the sophistication of new malware attacking control systems--malware including zero-days attacks, rootkits created for control systems, and software signed by trusted certificate authorities--has shown that it is very difficult to prevent and detect these attacks based solely on IT system information. In this paper we show how, by incorporating knowledge of the physical system under control, we are able to detect computer attacks that change the behavior of the targeted control system. By using knowledge of the physical system we are able to focus on the final objective of the attack, and not on the particular mechanisms of how vulnerabilities are exploited, and how the attack is hidden. We analyze the security and safety of our mechanisms by exploring the effects of stealthy attacks, and by ensuring that automatic attack-response mechanisms will not drive the system to an unsafe state. A secondary goal of this paper is to initiate the discussion between control and security practitioners--two areas that have had little interaction in the past. We believe that control engineers can leverage security engineering to design--based on a combination of their best practices--control algorithms that go beyond safety and fault tolerance, and include considerations to survive targeted attacks.},

Two fundamental problems have been examined: 1) How different are various vehicle routing algorithms? 2) How valuable is real-time traffic information or historical traffic information in helping vehicle routing? Different from most previous works based on simulations, we presented performance comparisons of four routing algorithms using real GPS sensory data from 4000 taxis. It has been shown that using real-time traffic information could substantially improve the quality of vehicle path routing. This can bene- fit an individual driver, because through our evaluation results on realistic vehicle traces we found that the paths selected by taxi drivers are not as good as expected. More importantly, utilizing real-time information could improve global transportation efficiency in terms of dispers- ing/managing traffic, which plays a key role in construct- ing an effective vehicular CPS.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are sensing, communication and processing platforms, deeply embedded in physical processes and provide real-time monitoring and actuation services. Such systems are becoming increasing common in enabling many of the pervasive computing technologies that are becoming available today such as, smart-homes, smart-vehicles, pervasive health monitoring systems. Given the automation that CPSs introduce in managing physical processes, and the detail of information available to them for carrying out their tasks, securing them is of prime importance. In this dissertation, a novel security paradigm for CPSs is proposed, called Cyber-Physical Security (CYPSec). CYPSec solutions are unique in that they take they take into account the environmentally-coupled nature of CPSs in enabling security solutions. This dissertation explores CYPSec solutions for two diverse but related problems. The first is a usable and secure key agreement protocol called Physiological Signal based Key Agreement (PSKA), which combines signal processing and cryptographic primitives to enable automated key agreement between sensors in a Body Area Network (BAN) without any form of external user involvement. It uses specific physiological stimuli-based features (Photoplethsymogram and Electrocardio- gram) from the human body for its task. The second is an access control model called Criticality Aware Access Control (CAAC), which facilitates a more adaptive and proactive provisioning of authorizations - provide the right set of privileges for the right set of subjects, at the right time for the right duration - for managing emergencies within smart-infrastructures.},

abstract = {A probe data service has been defined as a means for vehicular on-board units (OBUs) to transmit the data collected by their in-vehicle sensors in real time via wireless communication links to road-site units (RSUs). Sensor data fusion algorithms are developed in this work to aggregate data collected through this probe data service for computing single-RSU and multi-RSU average per-division speeds and average route travel times, where a division is defined to be a small segment of a road. These algorithms are evaluated using an integrated simulation testbed that consists of a vehicular simulator and a wireless communication link simulator, which are interconnected via a TCP/IP connection. Our key findings are that the probe data service offers an excellent means for computing average per-division speeds and average route travel times when the market penetration level of OBUs is relatively high. Privacy constraints negatively impact the accuracy of route travel time estimates as routes often span roads under the wireless coverage area of many road-side units requiring frequent vehicle identity changes. The impact of wireless communication losses is quite significant, requiring the use of accurate models in any simulation-based studies.},

Also, the automation CPSs bring in managing physical processes, and the detail of information available to them for carrying out their tasks, make securing them a prime importance. Securing CPSs is a difficult task as systems are interconnected. In order to achieve a continuous secured CPS environment, there is the need for an integrated methodology to analyze, specify and prioritize security requirements and also to develop policies to meet them. First, CPS assets are represented using high-order object models. Second, swimlane diagrams are extended to include malactivities and prevention or mitigation options to decompose use cases. We analyze security threats pertaining to the hardware components, software components and the hardware-software interaction. Security requirements are then specified, and an analytical prioritization approach, based on relative priority analysis is employed to prioritize them. Finally, security policies are then developed to meet the requirements. To demonstrate its effectiveness and evaluate its application, the proposed methodology is applied in a structured approach to a testbed – Ayushman, a Pervasive Health Monitoring System (PHMS).},

abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have attracted a lot of attention over the last few years. They have become a fundamental component of many intelligent transportation systems and VANETs are being used to improve road safety and enable a wide variety of value-added services. Many forms of attacks against VANETs have emerged recently that attempt to compromise the security of such networks. Such security attacks on VANETs may lead to catastrophic results such as the loss of lives or loss of revenue for those value-added services. Therefore making VANETs secure has become a key objective for VANET designers. To develop and deploy secure VANET infrastructures remains a significant challenge. The authors discuss some of the main security threats and attacks that can be exploited in VANETs and present the corresponding security solutions that can be implemented to thwart those attacks.},

abstract = {Inter-vehicle communication (IVC) systems (i.e., systems not relying on road- side infrastructure) have the potential to radically improve the safety, efficiency, and comfort of everyday road travel. Their main advantage is that they bypass the need for expensive infrastructure; their major drawback is the comparatively complex networking protocols and the need for significant penetration before their applications can become effective. In this article we present several major classes of applications and the types of services they require from an underlying network. We then proceed to analyze existing networking protocols in a bottom-up fashion, from the physical to the trans- port layers, as well as security aspects related to IVC systems. We conclude the article by presenting several projects related to IVC as well as a review of common performance evaluation techniques for IVC systems.},

They are subject to limited communication conditions when compared with nodes specifically designed to this context. Existing works either consider antennas installed on top of the vehicle roof or nodes that operate in infrastructure mode. In this article, we investigate through real experiments the characteristics of links formed by in-car nodes running off-the-shelf wireless technologies such as IEEE 802.11(a/g) in ad hoc mode. We surprisingly observe that in-car nodes do show enough performance in terms of network capacity to be used in a number of applications, such as file transfer in peer-to-peer applications. Nonetheless, we identify some key performance issues and devise a number of configuration recommendations and future work directions.},

abstract = {It is essential to consider drivers' perceptions and reactions when building Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems (VCPS) since the effectiveness and efficiency of VCPS will largely depend on how drivers could benefit from such a system. This paper considers, for the first time, novel service scheduling problems from a Human Factors (HF) standpoint by taking into consideration the following fact: a driver may not be able to receive more than one service in a short period of time, even if multiple services can be transmitted to the driver from the conventional communications and networking standpoint. We study a family of the HF-aware Service Scheduling (HFSS) Problems, where the goal is to deliver up to n services, each having a time-dependent (and possibly decreasing) utility to a subset of intended drivers so as to minimize the system-wide total utility loss due to unsuccessful delivery of some services. We show that such problems are different from all existing problems. We formulate the basic HFSS problem (BHFSSP) using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and prove its NP-Completeness. We then propose efficient heuristics for BHFSSP and its more general versions, and present numerical results from large-scale test cases. We also address several practical issues related to wireless transmission failures, distributed implementation in the multisender scenario, and other HF related considerations.},

abstract = {One of the main characteristics of a Cyber Physical System (CPS) is the tight coupling of the computing and communications aspects of the system with its physical dynamics. In this paper, we examine this characteristic for a cooperative vehicle safety (CVS) system, and identify how the design and operation of such CPSs should consider this tight coupling. In CVS systems, vehicles broadcast their physical state information over a shared wireless network to allow their neighbors to track them and predict possible collisions. The physical dynamics of vehicle movement and the required accuracy from tracking process dictate certain load on the network. The network performance is directly affected by the amount of offered load, and in turn directly affects the tracking process and its required load. The tight mutual dependence of physical dynamics of vehicle (physical component), estimation/tracking process and communication process (cyber components) require a new look at how such systems are designed and operated. We consider these factors and propose methods to simplify the design procedure for such tightly coupled systems. The method includes modeling the subcomponent of the CPS and devising interaction and control algorithms to operate them. The proposed methods are compared with methods based on separate design of components that deal with physical and cyber aspects. Through simulation experiments we show significant gains in performance when CPS design considerations are respected.},

abstract = {Vehicular networks are a classic example of mobile, peer-to-peer networks. The domain of intelligent transportation engineering (ITS) envisions a wide range of services over these vehicular networks. Supporting the different quality of service properties of these services requires effective dynamic resource management solutions in vehicular networks, which cannot be realized using vehicles alone due to factors such as varying vehicular mobility patterns, varying vehicular traffic density, and obstacles. Road side units (RSUs), which serve as event and data brokers among the moving vehicles, can alleviate this problem. To maximize the value proposition offered by RSUs requires their effective placement that holistically accounts for physical factors, such as traffic patterns and mobility, with cyber factors, such as communication protocols and messaging. To address these requirements, this paper presents a design methodology based on the principles of surrogate modeling wherein small- scale, micro-simulations of the ITS cyber-physical system are used to develop training points, which in turn are used to train a surrogate model. The surrogate model is subsequently used to make planning decisions for ITS.},

We utilize the hierarchical model developed to analyze the performance characteristics of these two techniques and identify optimal design settings under which the reliability of the CPS may be maximized. The analysis reveals design tradeoffs in security assurance and energy consumption, and suggests that enviroconsistency be used over positional discontinuity for reliability maximization.

With the proposed scheme, vehicles can verify a batch of signatures once instead of in a one-by-one manner. Hence the message verification speed can be tremendously increased. To identify invalid signatures in a batch of signatures, this paper adopts group testing technique, which can find the invalid signatures with few number of batch verifications. In addition, a trust authority in our scheme is capable of tracing a vehicle's real identity from its pseudo identity, and therefore conditional privacy preserving can also be achieved. Moreover, since identity-based cryptography is employed in the scheme to generate private keys for pseudo identities, certificates are not required and thus transmission overhead can be significantly reduced.},

In the past few decades, security in the military operations is exposed to vulnerabilities like sniffing the information and modifying the data causing havoc in military camps. Consequently military applications required a secure way to exchange the data and stay away from enemy intrusion. Recent trends in military operations need a portable way of communicating between the units, quality of service and security to be full-fledged. However, in MANET mobile entities are prone to various security attacks due to dynamic changing topology, open medium and inhibited by limited energy, bandwidth and computational power. The paper addresses the security issues by incorporating the concept of Trust and Certification Authority to combat the misbehaving entities. Certificate Authority employs Fuzzy based analyzer to distinguish between trusted and malicious behavior of nodes by distributing the certificates only to the trusted nodes and detecting the misbehaving node. The proposed scheme is more secure, reliable and aids to improve the security in military operations.},

We propose the Detection of Malicious Vehicles (DMV) algorithm through monitoring to detect malicious nodes that drop or duplicate received packets and to isolate them from honest vehicles, where each vehicle is monitored by some of it trustier neighbors called verifier nodes. If a verifier vehicle observes an abnormal behavior from vehicle V, it increases distrust value of vehicle V. The ID of vehicle V is then reported to its relevant Certificate Authority (CA) as a malicious node when its distrust value is higher than a threshold value. Performance evaluation shows that DMV can detect most existence abnormal and malicious vehicles even at high speeds.},

With vehicle positions being the most frequently exchanged information in vehicular networks, it becomes imperative to establish a strong level of trust in the announced positions before a vehicle initiates a response. This paper proposes a position verification scheme as part of a misbehavior detection framework that encompasses analysis techniques needed for the verification of exchanged vehicular messages. The scheme involves the estimation of a vehicle's trajectory via the integration of road and map information, as opposed to only depending on the vehicle's kinematics for future trajectory prediction. The trajectory estimation procedure uses the vehicle's previously received position updates to find a bestfit area within the road topology in which the vehicle is expected to be. The vehicle's current position announcement is compared against this plausible area to decide whether the position is consistent with the expected location. Our proposed scheme is verified via extensive simulations, developed on ns2, demonstrating the importance of integrating road and map information into position verification.},

Detecting and evicting sources of such misbehavior is an important problem. We observe that the performance of misbehavior detection schemes will depend on the application under consideration and the mobility dynamics of the detecting vehicle. Further, the underlying tradeoff in any such detection algorithm is the balance between False Positives and False Negatives; one would like to detect as many misbehaviors as possible, while at the same time ensuring that the genuine vehicles are not wrongly accused. In this work we propose and analyze (via simulations) the performance of a Misbehavior Detection Scheme (MDS) for Post Crash Notification (PCN) application. We observe that the performance of this proposed scheme is not very sensitive to the exact dynamics of the vehicle on small scales, so that slight error in estimating the dynamics of the detecting vehicle does not degrade the performance of the MDS.},

abstract = {Future development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) depends on Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) in which communications will help to improve traffic safety and efficiency through exchanging information among vehicles. As each vehicle cannot be a source of all messages in VANET, most communications depend on the information received from other vehicles. To protect VANET from malicious action, each vehicle must be able to evaluate, decide and react locally on information received from other vehicles. Message verification is more challenging in VANETs since the security and privacy of the participating vehicles, in general, and of the drivers and passengers specifically is of major concern. Each vehicle needs to verify the accuracy of the message and needs to verify that the received message is from a legitimate vehicle. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to secure vehicular communication with the help of trust measured for the given period using a probabilistic approach. The proposed algorithm secures VANETs against the untrustworthy drivers. The proposed algorithm is illustrated through numerical results obtained from simulations.},

abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) is a class of ad hoc networks build to ensure the safety of traffic. This is important because accidents claim many lives. Trust and security remain a major concern in VANET since a simple mistake can have catastrophic consequence. A crucial point in VANET is how to trust the information transmitted when the neighboring vehicles are rapidly changing and moving in and out of range. Current reputation systems for VANET try to establish trust between entities, which might not be required for practical scenarios. Due to the ephemeral nature of VANET, reputation schemes for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) cannot be applied to VANET. In this thesis, we point out several limitations of reputation trust management schemes for VANET. In particular, we identify the problem of information cascading and oversampling, which commonly arise in social networks. Oversampling is a situation in which a node observing two or more nodes, takes into consideration both their opinions equally without knowing that they might have influenced each other in decision making. We show that simple voting for decision making, leads to oversampling. We propose a solution to overcome this problem in VANET. We also suggest new ways to merge reputation schemes with misbehavior detection schemes to establish a trustworthy VANET.},

abstract = {A transition from free flow to congested traffic on highways often originates spontaneously and despite the fact that the road could satisfy a higher traffic demand. The reasons for such a traffic breakdown are perturbations caused by human drivers in dense traffic. We present a strategy to reduce traffic congestion with the help of vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Periodically emitted beacons are used to analyze traffic flow and to warn other drivers of a possible traffic breakdown. Drivers who receive such a warning are told to keep a larger gap to their predecessor. By doing so, they are less likely the source of perturbations which can cause a traffic breakdown. We analyze the proposed strategy via computer simulations and investigate which fraction of communicating vehicles is necessary until a beneficial influence on traffic flow is observable. We show that penetration rates of ten percent and less can have significant influence on traffic flow and travel times. Besides applying a realistic mobility model we further increase the degree of realism by the use of empirical traffic data from loop detectors on a German Autobahn.},

abstract = {This article describes a scheme which to the best of our knowledge is the first one to use user signatures to share information about Points of Interest in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks. In this scheme, users rate restaurants, hotels, etc. and sign those rates with their private key. Then, they broadcast that information and other vehicles store it for future use. When another user needs a Point of Interest recommendation he queries the system for the other users stored reviews and after he visits that Points of Interest for himself, he evaluates it and his level of trust in the reviewers with rates similar to his own increases. In the end, a user will be able to request to his vehicle information on a certain Point of Interest category and it will respond with the recommendations made by other users, prioritizing the ones in the user's Web of Trust. poiSim is the tool designed to simulate this scheme. It processes a 24 h mobility trace produced by a Multi-Agent Traffic Simulator, which realistically simulates public and private traffic over regional maps of Switzerland. The result is a Chains of Trust simulation with over 260,000 nodes, which shows that the proposed scheme performs satisfactorily in a realistic scenario.},

In this paper, we review the techniques for handling misbehavior in VANETs, particularly where anony- mous communications are desired to conserve user privacy since it adds more complexity to the defense against misbehavior. A new scheme is proposed to punish misbehaving users and can be employed in both inter-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure anonymous communications.

Vehicle-to-vehicle communication, in particular, frequent cooperative awareness messages or safety beacons, has been considered over the past years as a main approach. Meanwhile, the need to provide security and to safeguard users' privacy is well understood, and security architectures for VC systems have been proposed. Although technical approaches to secure VC have several commonalities and a consensus has formed, there are critical questions that have remained largely unanswered: Are the proposed security and privacy schemes practical? Can the secured VC systems support the VC-enabled applications as effectively as unsecured VC would? How should security be designed so that its integration into a VC system has a limited effect on the system's performance? In this paper, we provide answers to these questions, investigating the joint effect of a set of system parameters and components. We consider the state-of-the-art approach in secure VC, and we evaluate analytically and through simulations the interdependencies among components and system characteristics. Overall, we identify key design choices for the deployment of efficient, effective, and secure VC systems.},

abstract = {Detecting misbehavior (such as transmissions of false information) in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is a very important problem with wide range of implications, including safety related and congestion avoidance applications. We discuss several limitations of existing misbehavior detection schemes (MDS) designed for VANETs. Most MDS are concerned with detection of malicious nodes. In most situations, vehicles would send wrong information because of selfish reasons of their owners, e.g. for gaining access to a particular lane. It is therefore more important to detect false information than to identify misbehaving nodes. We introduce the concept of data-centric misbehavior detection and propose algorithms which detect false alert messages and misbehaving nodes by observing their actions after sending out the alert messages. With the data-centric MDS, each node can decide whether an information received is correct or false. The decision is based on the consistency of recent messages and new alerts with reported and estimated vehicle positions. No voting or majority decisions is needed, making our MDS resilient to Sybil attacks. After misbehavior is detected, we do not revoke all the secret credentials of misbehaving nodes, as done in most schemes. Instead, we impose fines on misbehaving nodes (administered by the certification authority), discouraging them to act selfishly. This reduces the computation and communication costs involved in revoking all the secret credentials of misbehaving nodes.},

@article{Martinez2009,
abstract = {Wireless communication technologies have now greatly impact our daily lives. From indoor wireless LANs to outdoor cellular mobile networks, wireless technologies have benefited billions of users around the globe. The era of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is now evolving, gaining attention and momentum. Researchers and developers have built VANET simulation software to allow the study and evaluation of various media access, routing, and emergency warning protocols. VANET simulation is fundamentally different from MANETs (mobile ad hoc networks) simulation because in VANETs, vehicular environment imposes new issues and requirements, such as constrained road topology, multi-path fading and roadside obstacles, traffic flowmodels, trip models, varying vehicular speed and mobility, traffic lights, traffic congestion, drivers' behavior, etc. Currently, there are VANET mobility generators, network simulators, and VANET simulators. This paper presents a comprehensive study and comparisons of the various publicly available VANET simulation software and their components. In particular, we contrast their software characteristics, graphical user interface (GUI), popularity, ease of use, input requirements, output visualization capability, accuracy of simulation, etc. Finally, while each of the studied simulators provides a good simulation environment for VANETs, refinements and further contributions are needed before they can be widely used by the research community.

@article{Dressler2011,
abstract = {Intervehicle communication has become an extremely hot topic in networking research, opening up new research challenges well beyond those of classical mobile ad hoc network research. In October 2010, a Dagstuhl seminar has been organized bringing together many of the internationally leading experts in this field to discuss open issues and challenges related to IVC. This article reports the main findings of this meeting, that was set up to cover a wide range of topics. In particular, the following four areas were studied in working groups: Fundamental Limits and Opportunities of IVC, IVC Communication Principles and Patterns, Security and Privacy in IVC, and IVC Simulation and Modeling. A general conclusion drawn is that IVC is now at a turning point where the firstgeneration systems are engineered and will soon be brought to the market, while at the same time, IVC is experiencing the beginning of a new era characterized by a more fundamental research approach.},

@article{Markvollrath2011,
abstract = {Although Cruise Control (CC) is available for most cars, no studies have been found which examine how this automation system influences driving behaviour. However, a relatively large number of studies have examined Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) which compared to CC includes also a distance control. Besides positive effects with regard to a better compliance to speed limits, there are also indications of smaller distances to lead vehicles and slower responses in situations that require immediate braking. Similar effects can be expected for CC as this system takes over longitudinal control as well. To test this hypothesis, a simulator study was conducted at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Twenty-two participants drove different routes (highway and motorway) under three different conditions (assisted by ACC, CC and manual driving without any system). Different driving scenarios were examined including a secondary task condition. On the one hand, both systems lead to lower maximum velocities and less speed limit violations. There was no indication that drivers shift more of their attention towards secondary tasks when driving with CC or ACC. However, there were delayed driver reactions in critical situations, e.g., in a narrow curve or a fog bank. These results give rise to some caution regarding the safety effects of these systems, especially if in the future their range of functionality (e.g., ACC Stop-and-Go) is further increased.},

abstract = {The complexity and connectivity of modern ve- hicles has constantly increased over the past years. Within the scope of this development the security risk for the in- vehicle network and its components has risen massively. Apart from threats for comfort and confidentiality, these attacks can also affect safety critical systems of the vehicle and therefore endanger the driver and other road users. In this paper the introduction of anomaly detection systems to the automotive in-vehicle network is discussed. Based on properties of typical vehicular networks, like the Controller Area Network (CAN), a set of anomaly detection sensors is introduced which allow the recognition of attacks during the operation of the vehicle without causing false positives. Moreover, important design and application criteria for a vehicular attack detection system are explained and discussed.},

abstract = {The development of automotive cyber-physical systems (CPS) software needs to consider not only functional requirements, but also non-functional requirements and the interaction with physical environment. In this paper, a model-based software development method for automotive CPS (MoBDAC) is presented. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, MoBDAC covers the whole development workflow of automotive CPS software from modeling and simulation to code generation. Automatic tools are used to improve the development efficiency. Second, MoBDAC extracts non- functional requirements and deals with them in the implementation model level and source code level, which helps to correctly manage and meet non-functional requirements. Third, MoBDAC defines three kinds of relations between uncertain physical environment events and software internal actions in automotive CPS, and uses Model Modifier to integrate the interaction with physical environment. Moreover, we illustrate the development workflow of MoBDAC by an example of a power window development.},

The experimental results show that the pre-diagnostic system can efficiently classify causes of error frames transmitted on aCANbus, and identify “network health” which indicates healthiness of the networkwhenbeing used for message communication. The potential causes of the faults can be narrowed down, and further network diagnostics and prognostics can be performed.},

@article{Sathiyan2011,
abstract = {The important feature of the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system is the ability to maintain a proper inter-vehicle gap based on the speed of leading vehicle and the desired distance. Adaptive Cruise Control operates in two modes (i) Velocity Control mode, (ii) Distance Control mode. ACC acts like a conventional Cruise Controller (CC) under velocity control mode. In the case of the distance control mode, the speed of the host vehicle is reduced according to the surrounding environment to maintain the safe distance between the leading vehicle and the host vehicle. 25 rules have been used in Fuzzy logic Controller (FLC) with the knowledge base of the system. The inputs of the FLC are distance error and the speed error. The host vehicle adapts to the lead vehicle speed changes and tries to maintain a proper distance between them. The performance of the FLC based ACC is improved by Genetic Algorithm to tune the fuzzy rule base. Genetic Programming is used to select the best rule out of the 25 for a corresponding input. The result showed a better improvement over the Fuzzy Controlled System.},

abstract = {The potential for vehicular applications is rapidly increasing. However this variety also demands a flexible multihop communication protocol supporting different communications needs and adapting to the network environment and to context elements specified by the application itself. We think that adaptive solutions, recently starting to be applied to VANET routing and dissemination protocols, have a great potential for solving the problems stated above. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the reader to these kinds of solutions, show their benefits and also mention the challenges involved. Because one important aspect of adaptive solutions (in this case a common communication protocol for all applications), is having in-depth knowledge of the problem to solve, we first review these different vehicular applications and their classification, followed by their communication needs.},
